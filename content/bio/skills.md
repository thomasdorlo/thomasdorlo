   name = "Idealist"
   description = "I firmly believe in health as a universal and fundamental human right. Unfortunately, the poorest in this world are systematically being denied this right: drugs are not being developed for the typical 'neglected' diseases they are suffering from and if drugs are available they have no access to them. My work and career are fully dedicated and guided by the conviction that even the most neglected populations and patients deserve good quality healthcare - and even a single individual can make a difference."
