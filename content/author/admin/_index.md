Thomas Dorlo is a pharmacometrician and clinical pharmacology expert. His research interests include neglected tropical diseases, international health, and anything related to modeling of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). <br><br>
He is leading a group that focuses on clinical pharmacology, bioanalysis, biomarker evaluation, and modeling and simulation of PK and PD, for parasitic poverty-related diseases such as leishmaniasis (both cutaneous and visceral) and malaria. He co-leads the pharmacometrics group at the [NKI](http://www.nki.nl), supervising PhD students working on applied pharmacometrics in oncology and maintaining the high-performance computing resources. His research is particularly focused on optimization of drug therapy in vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women and children. His work is supported by a Veni fellowship from the [Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)](http://www.nwo.nl) and various [EDCTP](http://www.edctp.org) grants. <br><br>
Thomas is also a board member of the [Dutch Society against Quackery](http://www.kwakzalverij.nl) and publishes regularly on non-scientific alternative medicine, such as homeopathy and traditional medicine.
