abstract = "Despite the increasing global recognition of the value of evidence-based medicine, the World Health Organization (WHO) still appears to be on a quest to promote the integration of consistently unproven and irrational therapies (quackery) into medicine worldwide. In a shameful recent advertising supplement in Science, fully sponsored by two Chinese universities, Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO, calls once again for integrating traditional medicine (TM) with scientific medicine."
