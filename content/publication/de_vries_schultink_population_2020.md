abstract = "Background and objectives: MCLA-128 is a bispecific monoclonal antibody targeting the HER2 and HER3 receptors and is in development to overcome HER3-mediated resistance to anti-HER2 therapies. The aims of this analysis were to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of MCLA-128 in patients with various solid tumors, to evaluate patient-related factors that affect the disposition of MCLA-128, and to assess whether flat dosing is appropriate. <br> Methods: MCLA-128 concentration data following intravenous administration were collected in a phase I/II clinical trial. Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. Different compartmental models were evaluated. Various body size parameters including body weight, body surface area, and fat-free mass were evaluated as covariates in addition to age, sex, HER2 status, and tumor burden. <br>Results: In total, 1115 serum concentration measurements were available from 116 patients. The pharmacokinetics of MCLA-128 was best described by a two-compartment model with linear and non-linear (Michaelis-Menten) clearance. Fat-free mass significantly affected the linear clearance and volume of distribution of the central compartment of MCLA-128, explaining 8.4% and 5.6% of inter-individual variability, respectively. Tumor burden significantly affected the non-linear clearance capacity. Simulations demonstrated that dosing based on body size parameters resulted in similar area under the plasma concentration-time curve for a dosing interval (AUC0-Ï„), maximum and trough concentrations of MCLA-128, compared to flat dosing. <br>Conclusions: This analysis demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of MCLA-128 exhibits similar disposition characteristics to other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and that a flat dose of MCLA-128 in patients with various solid tumors is appropriate."
