abstract = "Purpose: NLG207 (formerly CRLX101) is a nanoparticle-drug conjugate (NDC) of the potent topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin (CPT). The present study sought to characterize the complex pharmacokinetics (PK) of NLG207 and better describe CPT release from nanoparticles using a population PK (popPK) model.<br><br>Methods: From 27 patients enrolled on two phase II clinical trials (NCT02769962 and NCT03531827), dense sampling was performed up to 48 h post-administration of NLG207 during cycle one and six of treatment; samples were also collected at ~ 360 h post-dose. Conjugated and free CPT concentrations were quantified from each sample, resulting in 477 observations to build a popPK model using non-linear mixed-effects modeling.<br><br>Results: The PK of NLG207 was characterized by combining two linear two-compartment models with first-order kinetics each to describe nanoparticle-bound (conjugated) and free CPT. Allometric scaling based on body weight provided the best body-size descriptor for all PK parameters. The typical volumes of distribution of the conjugated CPT central and free CPT central compartments were 3.16 L (BSV CV%; 18.1%) and 21.1 L (CV%; 79.8%), respectively. CPT release from the nanoparticle formulation was characterized via an initial rapid clearance of 5.71 L/h (CV%; 62.6%), which decreased via first-order decay (estimated half-life of 0.307 h) to the steady-state value of 0.0988 L/h (CV%; 33.5%) by ~ 4 h after end of infusion. Renal clearance of free CPT was 0.874 L/h (CV%; 42.2%).<br><br>Conclusion: The popPK model confirmed nanoparticle behavior of conjugated CPT and mechanistically characterized CPT release from NLG207. The current analysis provides a strong foundation for future study as a potential predictive tool in ongoing NLG207 clinical trials."
