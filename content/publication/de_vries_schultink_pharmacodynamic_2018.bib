  abstract = {Trastuzumab is associated with cardiotoxicity, manifesting as a decrease of the left-ventricular ejection fraction ({LVEF}). Administration of anthracyclines prior to trastuzumab increases risk of cardiotoxicity. High-sensitive troponin T and N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide ({NT}-{proBNP}) are molecular markers that may allow earlier detection of drug-induced cardiotoxicity. In this analysis we aimed to quantify the kinetics and exposure-response relationships of {LVEF}, troponin T and {NT}-{proBNP} measurements, in patients receiving anthracycline and trastuzumab. Repeated measurements of {LVEF}, troponin T and {NT}-{proBNP} and dosing records of anthracyclines and trastuzumab were available from a previously published clinical trial. This trial included 206 evaluable patients with early breast cancer. Exposure to anthracycline and trastuzumab was simulated based on available dosing records and by using a kinetic-pharmacodynamic (K-{PD}) and a fixed pharmacokinetic ({PK}) model from literature, respectively. The change from baseline troponin T was described with a direct effect model, affected by simulated anthracycline concentrations, representing myocyte damage. The relationship between trastuzumab and {LVEF} was described by an indirect effect compartment model. The {EC}50 for {LVEF} decline was significantly affected by the maximum troponin T concentration after anthracycline treatment, explaining 15.1\% of inter-individual variability. In this cohort, {NT}-{proBNP} changes could not be demonstrated to be related to anthracycline or trastuzumab treatment. Pharmacodynamic models for troponin T and {LVEF} were successfully developed, identifying maximum troponin T concentration after anthracycline treatment as a significant determinant for trastuzumab-induced {LVEF} decline. These models can help identify patients at risk of drug-induced cardiotoxicity and optimize cardiac monitoring strategies.},
