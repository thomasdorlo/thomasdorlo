	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment options for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in East Africa are far from satisfactory due to cost, toxicity, prolonged treatment duration or emergence of parasite resistance. Hence there is a need to explore alternative treatment protocols such as miltefosine alone or in combinations including miltefosine, sodium stibogluconate (SSG) or liposomal amphotericin B. The aim of this trial is to identify regimen(s) which are sufficiently promising for future trials in East Africa.
METHODS/DESIGN: A phase II randomized, parallel arm, open-labelled trial is being conducted to assess the efficacy of each of the three regimens: liposomal amphotericin B with SSG, Liposomal amphotericin B with miltefosine and miltefosine alone. The primary endpoint is cure at day 28 with secondary endpoint at day 210 (6 months). Initial cure is a single composite measure based on parasitologic evaluation (bone marrow, spleen or lymph node aspirate) and clinical assessment. Repeated interim analyses have been planned after recruitment of 15 patients in each arm with a maximum sample size of 63 for each. These will follow group-sequential methods (the triangular test) to identify when a regimen is inadequate ({\textless}75\% efficacy) or adequate ({\textgreater}90\% efficacy). We describe a method to ensure consistency of the sequential analysis of day 28 cure with the non-sequential analysis of day 210 cure.
DISCUSSION: A regimen with adequate efficacy would be a candidate for treatment of VL with reasonable costs. The design allows repeated testing throughout the trial recruitment period while maintaining good statistical properties (Type I \& II error rates) and reducing the expected sample sizes.

Vibrational spectroscopy provided chemically specific information on the composition of the tablets; the complementary nature of Raman scattering and FTIR imaging allowed the characterization of both the overall and surface composition of the tablets. The depth-resolving power of the SORS approach provided chemically specific information on the overall composition of the tablets, non-invasively, through a variety of packaging types. Spatial imaging of the tablet surface (using ATR-FTIR) identified the location of domains of excipients and active ingredients with high sensitivity and enhanced spatial resolution. The advantages provided by a combination of SORS and ATR-FTIR imaging in this context confirm its potential for inclusion in the analytical protocol for forensic investigation of counterfeit medicines.},

Miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine, Impavido™), a novel antiprotozoal drug used for the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, was identified and evaluated independently in the early 1980s as a potential anticancer drug in Germany and as an antileishmanial drug in the UK. Although miltefosine is not the most active compound of its class against Leishmania parasites in vitro, the early demonstration of activity after oral administration in experimental models of visceral leishmaniasis helped to bring this compound to the attention of WHO TDR for further development in a unique collaboration model with the pharmaceutical industry (Zentaris GmbH). Miltefosine is active against most Leishmania species, including those that cause cutaneous disease.},

A male patient with psoriatic arthritis and visceral Leishmania infantum infection was treated with oral miltefosine 50\&\#xa0;mg three times a day for 4 weeks at the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Miltefosine plasma concentrations were measured with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The parasite load was followed by quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA) assay in blood. Miltefosine elicited a prompt therapeutic effect. After an initial worsening of symptoms and an increase of QT-NASBA values during the first week, recovery was rapidly achieved. QT-NASBA values declined exponentially and were negative after 6 weeks. Miltefosine plasma concentrations continued to accumulate during the 4 weeks of treatment. The terminal elimination half-life was 14.8 days.},

Based in both the importance of canids as reservoirs for the human disease and the fact that the canine disease may be an excellent model for the human condition, the present work has been conducted to analyze clinical and immune mechanisms associated with canine experimental leishmaniasis. Six-month-old mixed-breed dogs were intravenously infected with L. infantum promastigotes and the infection course was monitored along a 343 days-period. On day 75 post-infection (p.i.), amastigotes were observed in the lymph nodes of all dogs. The analysis of the humoral response against total L. infantum antigens by both ELISA and Western blotting evidenced a correlation between the levels of IgG isotypes (IgG1 and IgG2) and disease progression. It was observed that in those animals showing either a regressive or an oligosymptomatic form of the disease, the anti-Leishmania IgG1 antibodies were undetectable whereas those animals developing active disease showed high levels of anti-Leishmania IgG1 antibodies. Additionally, the time-course of antibody production against L. infantum recombinant antigens in the experimentally infected dogs has been analyzed. The present data suggest that reactivity against the heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) may be used as diagnostic marker of early steps of infection, and that the appearance of anti-histone antibodies is associated with progression of infection to disease status.},

Poor-quality antimalarial drugs lead to drug resistance and inadequate treatment, which pose an urgent threat to vulnerable populations and jeopardise progress and investments in combating malaria. Emergence of artemisinin resistance or tolerance in Plasmodium falciparum on the Thailand–Cambodia border makes protection of the effectiveness of the drug supply imperative. We reviewed published and unpublished studies reporting chemical analyses and assessments of packaging of antimalarial drugs. Of 1437 samples of drugs in five classes from seven countries in southeast Asia, 497 (35\%) failed chemical analysis, 423 (46\%) of 919 failed packaging analysis, and 450 (36\%) of 1260 were classified as falsified. In 21 surveys of drugs from six classes from 21 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, 796 (35\%) of 2297 failed chemical analysis, 28 (36\%) of 77 failed packaging analysis, and 79 (20\%) of 389 were classified as falsified. Data were insufficient to identify the frequency of substandard (products resulting from poor manufacturing) antimalarial drugs, and packaging analysis data were scarce. Concurrent interventions and a multifaceted approach are needed to define and eliminate criminal production, distribution, and poor manufacturing of antimalarial drugs. Empowering of national medicine regulatory authorities to protect the global drug supply is more important than ever.},

At the first evaluation, the median total number of cells in ML patients (1,540,000) was greater than that in CL patients (215,000) or that in healthy subjects (250,000). Neutrophils were predominant in ML patients, in contrast to both sets of controls, in whom epithelial cells were more frequent. During treatment, we found a significant reduction in total nasal cell counts in ML patients who were cured, and encountered a switch in predominant cell type. The cytology of 2 patients who did not respond to antimony remained the same. It is therefore possible to detect nasal inflammation in ML patients through QNCs, which may indicate extension of mucosal involvement, providing an objective parameter to monitor therapy.},

	abstract = {Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has a fatal course if not properly treated. Recovery from VL is linked to cellular immune response. Unresponsiveness to antimonial therapy reinforces the importance of determining parameters for treatment assessment. We analysed the pre- and post-treatment serum levels of soluble CD4 (sCD4), sCD8, sIL-2R, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and neopterin in groups of VL patients either responsive or not to standard antimonial therapy. Pretreatment serum levels of all markers except for sICAM-1 were significantly higher in VL patients than in healthy subjects from the same area (P {\textless} 0.05). sICAM-1 levels were similar in healthy controls and in VL patients refractory to antimonial therapy (P = 0.25), but significantly higher in patients responsive to treatment (P = 0.02). The comparison of pre- and post-treatment concentrations showed that all markers, except sCD4 and sICAM-1, presented a significant fall (P {\textless} 0.05) in patients responsive to antimonial therapy. However, only neopterin presented with levels compatible with those of healthy subjects at the end of treatment (P = 0.30). In refractory patients sICAM-1 presented with post-treatment levels significantly higher than the pretreatment determinations (P = 0.03), while sCD4 experienced a significant drop (P = 0.01). All markers displayed clearly distinct behaviour according to the patient's response to therapy. This makes all soluble molecules studied suitable for use as indicators of antimonial therapy response. Additionally the comparison of pretreatment levels of the markers between responders and refractory patients to antimonial therapy showed that serum concentrations of sIL-2R and sICAM-1 significantly differed among these two groups (P = 0.02 in each case), suggesting that they may be used in future as predictors of antimonial therapy response.},

	abstract = {Pentamidine has a long history in the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and leishmaniasis. Early guidelines on the dosage of pentamidine were based on the base-moiety of the two different formulations available. Confusion on the dosage of pentamidine arose from a different labelling of the two available products, either based on the salt or base moiety available in the preparation. We provide an overview of the various guidelines concerning HAT and leishmaniasis over the past decades and show the confusion in the calculation of the dosage of pentamidine in these guidelines and the subsequent published reports on clinical trials and reviews. At present, only pentamidine isethionate is available, but the advised dosage for HAT and leishmaniasis is (historically) based on the amount of pentamidine base. In the treatment of leishmaniasis this is probably resulting in a subtherapeutic treatment. There is thus a need for a new, more transparent and concise guideline concerning the dosage of pentamidine, at least in the treatment of HAT and leishmaniasis.},

	abstract = {Hexadecylphosphocholine (HPC) has been investigated intensively for its cancerostatic properties. One explanation for the mechanism of action of HPC assumes that it plays a role in stimulation of the immune system. In particular, its potency to activate macrophages has already been recognised for different lyso- and ether lipids. Important steps in the cascade for developing cytotoxic effects of macrophages on tumor cells are the release of nitric oxide radicals (NO) and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The aim of our study was to examine the role of HPC as primer and/or trigger for macrophage activation to cytotoxicity. In our experiments we used HPC in free (micellar) or liposomal form in different primer/trigger combinations with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A weak change in morphology was revealed by electron microscopy, if macrophages were harvested from mice previously treated with HPC or HPC multilamellar vesicles. This observation was quantified by the measurement of NO, TNF and cytotoxic activity of the peritoneal macrophages. A specific release of NO was induced by the combination of in vivo treatment with liposomal HPC and subsequent stimulation by LPS in vitro. This process started only after 12 h of in vitro incubation of macrophages with the endotoxin. The release of TNF was dependent of the primer/trigger combination used. A moderate priming effect was obtained with HPC in liposomal form independently of the trigger. On the other hand, liposomes as priming agents were found to induce a dramatic increase in TNF release after in vitro coculture with the trigger LPS. The high release of NO and TNF is accompanied by only a weak increase in tumor cytostasis. The best results were once more found with macrophages primed with liposomal HPC and then triggered with LPS.},

	abstract = {Metabolic rate, heart rate, lifespan, and many other physiological properties vary with body mass in systematic and interrelated ways. Present empirical data suggest that these scaling relationships take the form of power laws with exponents that are simple multiples of one quarter. A compelling explanation of this observation was put forward a decade ago by West, Brown, and Enquist (WBE). Their framework elucidates the link between metabolic rate and body mass by focusing on the dynamics and structure of resource distribution networks-the cardiovascular system in the case of mammals. Within this framework the WBE model is based on eight assumptions from which it derives the well-known observed scaling exponent of 3/4. In this paper we clarify that this result only holds in the limit of infinite network size (body mass) and that the actual exponent predicted by the model depends on the sizes of the organisms being studied. Failure to clarify and to explore the nature of this approximation has led to debates about the WBE model that were at cross purposes. We compute analytical expressions for the finite-size corrections to the 3/4 exponent, resulting in a spectrum of scaling exponents as a function of absolute network size. When accounting for these corrections over a size range spanning the eight orders of magnitude observed in mammals, the WBE model predicts a scaling exponent of 0.81, seemingly at odds with data. We then proceed to study the sensitivity of the scaling exponent with respect to variations in several assumptions that underlie the WBE model, always in the context of finite-size corrections. Here too, the trends we derive from the model seem at odds with trends detectable in empirical data. Our work illustrates the utility of the WBE framework in reasoning about allometric scaling, while at the same time suggesting that the current canonical model may need amendments to bring its predictions fully in line with available datasets.},

	abstract = {Limited information is available on the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters driving the efficacy of antimalarial drugs. Our objective in this study was to determine dose-response relationships of a panel of related spiroindolone analogs and identify the PK-PD index that correlates best with the efficacy of KAE609, a selected class representative. The dose-response efficacy studies were conducted in the Plasmodium berghei murine malaria model, and the relationship between dose and efficacy (i.e., reduction in parasitemia) was examined. All spiroindolone analogs studied displayed a maximum reduction in parasitemia, with 90\% effective dose (ED90) values ranging between 6 and 38 mg/kg of body weight. Further, dose fractionation studies were conducted for KAE609, and the relationship between PK-PD indices and efficacy was analyzed. The PK-PD indices were calculated using the in vitro potency against P. berghei (2× the 99\% inhibitory concentration [IC99]) as a threshold (TRE). The percentage of the time in which KAE609 plasma concentrations remained at {\textgreater}2× the IC99 within 48 h (\%T{\textgreater}TRE) and the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 48 h (AUC0-48)/TRE ratio correlated well with parasite reduction (R2=0.97 and 0.95, respectively) but less so for the maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax)/TRE ratio (R2=0.88). The present results suggest that for KAE609 and, supposedly, for its analogs, the dosing regimens covering a T{\textgreater}TRE of 100\%, AUC0-48/TRE ratio of 587, and a Cmax/TRE ratio of 30 are likely to result in the maximum reduction in parasitemia in the P. berghei malaria mouse model. This information could be used to prioritize analogs within the same class of compounds and contribute to the design of efficacy studies, thereby facilitating early drug discovery and lead optimization programs.},

Clinical and parasitological parameters were reassessed at the end of treatment and 6 months later. One patient died of intercurrent pneumonia on day 6. The other 79 patients demonstrated no parasites after treatment, had marked clinical improvement, and were deemed initially cured. Three patients had relapse, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. The final cure rate was 94\% for all enrolled patients and 95\% for evaluable patients. Side effects included mild-to-moderate vomiting or diarrhea (each in approximately 25\% of patients) and mild-to-moderate, transient elevations in the aspartate aminotransferase level during the early treatment phase (in 55\%).

In the era of multi-drug resistance, this is of particular importance in clinical areas characterized by high antibiotic use, such as the ICU. Antibiotic dose optimization in critically ill patients requires sound knowledge not only of the altered physiology in serious infections - including severe sepsis, septic shock and ventilator-associated pneumonia - but also of the pathogen-drug exposure relationship (i.e. pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index). An important consideration is the fact that extreme shifts in organ function, such as those seen in hyperdynamic patients or those with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, can have an impact upon drug exposure, and constant vigilance is required when reviewing antibiotic dosing regimens in the critically ill. The use of continuous renal replacement therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation remain important interventions in these patients; however, both of these treatments can have a profound effect on antibiotic exposure. We suggest placing emphasis on the use of therapeutic drug monitoring and dose individualization when optimizing therapy in these settings.},

The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the available data regarding the frequency, screening and prevention of the adverse events observed in adults during systemic corticosteroid therapy (topically administered corticosteroids are outside the remit of this review). These include clinical (i.e. adipose tissue redistribution, hypertension, cardiovascular risk, osteoporosis, myopathy, peptic ulcer, adrenal insufficiency, infections, mood disorders, ophthalmological disorders, skin disorders, menstrual disorders, aseptic necrosis, pancreatitis) and biological (i.e. electrolytes homeostasis, diabetogenesis, dyslipidaemia) events. Lastly, data about the prescription of corticosteroids during pregnancy are provided. This review underscores the absence of data on many of these adverse events (e.g. lipodystrophy, dyslipidaemia).

We analysed outcomes of pharmaceutical research and development over the past 25 years, and reviewed current public and private initiatives aimed at correcting the imbalance in research and development that leaves diseases that occur predominantly in the developing world largely unaddressed. We compiled data by searches of Medline and databases of the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, and reviewed current public and private initiatives through an analysis of recently published studies. We found that, of 1393 new chemical entities marketed between 1975 and 1999, only 16 were for tropical diseases and tuberculosis. There is a 13-fold greater chance of a drug being brought to market for central-nervous-system disorders or cancer than for a neglected disease. The pharmaceutical industry argues that research and development is too costly and risky to invest in low-return neglected diseases, and public and private initiatives have tried to overcome this market limitation through incentive packages and public-private partnerships. The lack of drug research and development for "non-profitable" infectious diseases will require new strategies. No sustainable solution will result for diseases that predominantly affect poor people in the South without the establishment of an international pharmaceutical policy for all neglected diseases. Private-sector research obligations should be explored, and a public-sector not-for-profit research and development capacity promoted.},

This metabolic remodeling is accompanied by mitochondrial hyperpolarization. We tested whether the small-molecule and orphan drug dichloroacetate (DCA) can reverse this cancer-specific metabolic and mitochondrial remodeling in glioblastoma. Freshly isolated glioblastomas from 49 patients showed mitochondrial hyperpolarization, which was rapidly reversed by DCA. In a separate experiment with five patients who had glioblastoma, we prospectively secured baseline and serial tumor tissue, developed patient-specific cell lines of glioblastoma and putative glioblastoma stem cells (CD133, nestin cells), and treated each patient with oral DCA for up to 15 months. DCA depolarized mitochondria, increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, and induced apoptosis in GBM cells, as well as in putative GBM stem cells, both in vitro and in vivo. DCA therapy also inhibited the hypoxia-inducible factor–1α, promoted p53 activation, and suppressed angiogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. The dose-limiting toxicity was a dose-dependent, reversible peripheral neuropathy, and there was no hematologic, hepatic, renal, or cardiac toxicity. Indications of clinical efficacy were present at a dose that did not cause peripheral neuropathy and at serum concentrations of DCA sufficient to inhibit the target enzyme of DCA, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase II, which was highly expressed in all glioblastomas. Metabolic modulation may be a viable therapeutic approach in the treatment of glioblastoma.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Morphine is widely used throughout the human life span. Several pharmacokinetic models have been proposed to predict how morphine clearance changes with weight and age. This study uses a large external data set to evaluate the ability of pharmacokinetic models to predict morphine doses.


METHODS

A data set of morphine clearance estimates was created from published reports in premature neonates, full-term neonates, infants, children, and adults. This external data set was used to evaluate published models for morphine clearance as well as other models proposed for use in neonates and infants. Morphine clearance predictions were used to predict morphine dose rates to achieve similar target concentrations in all age groups.


RESULTS

An allometric ¾ power model using weight combined with a sigmoid maturation model using postmenstrual age successfully predicted the morphine dose rate (within 25\% of target) in all age groups except infants [predicted dose 30\% under target (95\% CI, 7-46\%)]. Other published models based on empirical allometric scaling all made unacceptable predictions ({\textgreater}100\% of target) in at least one age group.


CONCLUSIONS

Clearance based on empirical allometric scaling predicted unacceptable doses. Theory-based allometric scaling combined with a maturation function has been confirmed by external evaluation to provide a sound basis for describing clearance and predicting morphine doses in humans of all ages.},

The study comprised a four treatment, four sequences, and four period cross-over design and used a tissue cage model, which permitted the collection of serum, inflamed tissue cage fluid (exudate) and non-inflamed tissue cage fluid (transudate). There were no clinically relevant differences in the PK profile of oxytetracycline when administered alone and when administered with carprofen. PK-PD integration was undertaken for a pathogenic strain of Mannheimia haemolytic (A1 76/1), by correlating in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and time-kill data with in vivo PK data obtained in the cross-over study. Based on in vitro susceptibility in cation adjusted Mueller Hinton Broth (CAMHB) and in vivo determined PK variables, ratios of maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under curve (AUC) to MIC and time for which concentration exceeded MIC (T{\textgreater}MIC) were determined. The CAMHB MIC data satisfied integrated PK/PD relationships predicted to achieve efficacy for approximately 48 h after dosing; mean values for serum were 5.13 (Cmax/MIC), 49.3 h (T{\textgreater}MIC) and 126.6 h (AUC(96h)/MIC). Similar findings were obtained when oxytetracycline was administered in the presence of carprofen, with PK-PD indices based on MIC determined in CAMHB. However, PK-PD integration of data, based on oxytetracycline MICs determined in the biological fluids, serum, exudate and transudate, suggest that it possesses, at most, limited direct killing activity against the M. haemolytica strain A1 76/1; mean values for serum were 0.277 (Cmax/MIC), 0 h (T{\textgreater}MIC) and 6.84 h (AUC(96h)/MIC). The data suggest that the beneficial therapeutic effects of oxytetracycline may depend, at least in part, on actions other than direct inhibition of bacterial growth.},

Against the axenically grown epimastigote form of the parasite, the IC50s after 120 h for ET-18-OCH3, miltefosine and ilmofosine were 3, 1 and 3 μM, respectively; at higher concentrations immediate lytic effects were observed. Eradication of the intracellular amastigote, grown inside Vero cells, was achieved at 0.1, 0.1 and 1 μM for ET-18-OCH3, miltefosine and ilmofosine, respectively. Analysis of the lipid composition of epimastigotes exposed to LPAs at their IC50 for 120 h showed that the ratio of phosphatidyl-choline (PC) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) changed from 1.5 in control cells to c. 0.67 in those treated with the analogues. A significant increase in the content of phosphatidylserine was also observed in treated cells. Intact epimastigotes efficiently incorporated radioactivity from l-[methyl-14C]methionine into PC, but not from [methyl-14C]choline. ET-18-OCH3 inhibited the incorporation of l-[methyl-14C]methionine into PC with an IC50 of 2 μM, suggesting that inhibition of the de novo synthesis through the Greenberg's pathway was a primary effect underlying the selective anti-parasitic activity of this compound. Antiproliferative synergism was observed as a consequence of combined treatment of epimastigotes with ET-18-OCH3 and ketoconazole, a sterol biosynthesis inhibitor, probably due to the fact that a secondary effect of the latter is also a blockade of PC synthesis at the level of PE-PC-N-methyl-transferase.},

This study evaluates the efficacy of miltefosine in the treatment of post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) patients recruited over a period of 5 years with 18 months of follow-up.
METHODOLOGY: In this study 86 confirmed cases of PKDL were treated with two different dosage regimens of miltefosine (Regimen I- 50mg twice daily for 90 days and Regimen II- 50 mg thrice for 60 days) and the clinical outcome assessed monthly. Cure/relapse was ascertained by clinical and histopathological examination, and measuring parasite burden by quantitative real-time PCR. In vitro susceptibility of parasites towards miltefosine was estimated at both promastigote and amastigote stages.
RESULTS: Seventy three of eighty six patients completed the treatment and achieved clinical cure. Approximately 4\% (3/73) patients relapsed by the end of 12 months follow-up, while a total of 15\% (11/73) relapsed by the end of 18 months. Relapse rate was significantly higher in regimen II (31\%) compared to regimen I (10.5\%)(P{\textless}0.005). Parasite load at the pre-treatment stage was significantly higher (P{\textless}0.005) in cases that relapsed compared to the cases that remained cured. In vitro susceptibility towards miltefosine of parasites isolated after relapse was significantly lower ({\textgreater}2 fold) in comparison with the pre-treatment isolates (P{\textless}0.005).
CONCLUSION: Relapse rate in PKDL following miltefosine treatment has increased substantially, indicating the need of introducing alternate drugs/ combination therapy with miltefosine.},

Few patients have survived after receiving experimental drug combinations, with or without brain lesion excisions. Some GAE survivors have been treated with a multi-drug regimen including miltefosine, an investigational anti-leishmanial agent with in vitro amebacidal activity. Miltefosine dosing for GAE has been based on leishmaniasis dosing because no data exist in humans concerning its pharmacologic distribution in the central nervous system. We describe results of limited cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum drug level testing performed during clinical management of a child with fatal GAE who was treated with a multiple drug regimen including miltefosine. Brain biopsy specimens, CSF, and sera were tested for B. mandrillaris using multiple techniques, including culture, real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemical techniques, and serology. CSF and serum miltefosine levels were determined using a liquid chromatography method coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The CSF miltefosine concentration on hospital admission day 12 was 0.4 μg/mL. The serum miltefosine concentration on day 37, about 80 h post-miltefosine treatment, was 15.3 μg/mL. These are the first results confirming some blood-brain barrier penetration by miltefosine in a human, although with low-level CSF accumulation. Further evaluation of brain parenchyma penetration is required to determine optimal miltefosine dosing for Balamuthia GAE, balanced with the drug's toxicity profile. Additionally, the Balamuthia isolate was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), demonstrating genetic variability in 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) sequences and possibly signaling the first identification of multiple Balamuthia strains with varying pathogenicities.},

While the current law and regulations permit the United States Food and Drug Administration to base the approval of a drug product on a determination the effect of the drug on an unvalidated surrogate marker (that is, one for which it is not known that an effect on the surrogate actually predicts the desired clinical benefit), there are a number of difficulties in interpreting trials that use surrogate markers as primary measures of drug effect.

Isolates that were obtained before the onset of MIL treatment, after completion of treatment (29th day), or at the time of treatment failure, were screened using in vitro promastigote assay. The MIL susceptibility of the pre-treatment isolates (N = 24, mean IC50 ± SEM = 3.74 ± 0.38 μM) was significantly higher than that of the post-treatment group (N = 26, mean IC50 ± SEM = 6.15 ± 0.52 μM; P = 0.0006) but was similar in the cured patients (N = 22, mean IC50 ± SEM = 5.58 ± 0.56 μM) and those who failed treatment (N = 28, mean IC50 ± SEM = 4.53 ± 0.47 μM). The pre/post-treatment results thus showed a 2-fold difference, whereas isolated from cured versus failed patients showed a similar susceptibility, suggesting that this higher tolerance is not responsible for MIL-treatment failure.

	abstract = {Amastin is a transmembrane glycoprotein found on the cell surfaces of trypanosomatid parasites. Encoded by a large, diverse gene family, amastin was initially described from the intracellular, amastigote stage of Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania donovani. Genome sequences have subsequently shown that the amastin repertoire is much larger in Leishmania relative to Trypanosoma. However, it is not known when this expansion occurred, whether it is associated with the origins of Leishmania and vertebrate parasitism itself, or prior to this. To examine the timing of amastin diversification, as well as the evolutionary mechanisms regulating gene repertoire and sequence diversity, this study sequenced the genomic regions containing amastin loci from two related insect parasites (Leptomonas seymouri and Crithidia sp.) and estimated a phylogeny for these and other amastin sequences. The phylogeny shows that amastin includes four subfamilies with distinct genomic positions, secondary structures, and evolution, which were already differentiated in the ancestral trypanosomatid. Diversification in Leishmania was initiated from a single ancestral locus on chromosome 34, with rapid derivation of novel loci through transposition and accelerated sequence divergence. This is absent from related organisms showing that diversification occurred after the origin of Leishmania. These results describe a substantial elaboration of amastin repertoire directly associated with the origin of Leishmania, suggesting that some amastin genes evolved novel functions crucial to cell function in leishmanial parasites after the acquisition of a vertebrate host.},

Objective To identify epidemiological and clinical risk factors for relapse of VL in patients recently treated with standard dosing of miltefosine in India and Nepal. Design Prospective observational study in three Primary Health Centers and one reference center in Muzaffarpur district, Bihar, India; and two zonal hospitals and a university hospital in South-east Nepal; records of all consenting patients diagnosed with VL and treated with miltefosine according to the current treatment guidelines of the Kala azar elimination program between 2009 and 2011. Results We compared the clinical records of 78 cases of relapse with those of 775 patients who had no record of subsequent relapse. Relapse was 2 times more common amongst male patients (IRR 2.14, 95\% CI 1.27–3.61), and 2 to 3 times more frequent in the age groups below 15 compared to the over 25 year olds (age 10 to 14: IRR 2.53; 95\% CI 1.37–4.65 and Age 2 to 9: IRR 3.19; 95\% CI 1.77–5.77). History of earlier VL episodes, or specific clinical features at time of diagnosis such as duration of symptoms or spleen size were no predictors of relapse. Conclusions Young age and male gender were associated with increased risk of VL relapse after miltefosine, suggesting that the mechanism of relapse is mainly host-related i.e. immunological factors and/or drug exposure (pharmacokinetics). The observed decrease in efficacy of miltefosine may be explained by the inclusion of younger patients compared to the earlier clinical trials, rather than by a decreased susceptibility of the parasite to miltefosine. Our findings highlight the importance of proper clinical trials in children, including pharmacokinetics, to determine the safety, efficacy, drug exposure and therapeutic response of new drugs in this age group.},

The burden of leishmaniasis falls disproportionately on the poorest segments of the global population.

Poverty is associated with poor nutrition and other infectious diseases, which increase the risk that a person (once infected) will progress to the clinically manifested disease. Lack of healthcare access causes delays in appropriate diagnosis and treatment and accentuates leishmaniasis morbidity and mortality, particularly in women. Leishmaniasis diagnosis and treatment are expensive and families must sell assets and take loans to pay for care, leading to further impoverishment and reinforcement of the vicious cycle of disease and poverty.

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17128357},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE

In 2002-03, the Republic of the Congo increased the threshold separating stage 1 and 2 cases of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) from a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white cell count of 5 cells/mm(3) to 10 cells/mm(3). We aimed to assess whether the increased threshold of 10 cells/mm(3) is a safe indicator of stage 2 disease.


METHODS

We assessed patients treated for stage 1 HAT caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense in the Republic of the Congo between April 2001 and April 2005. Patients with 0-10 cells/mm(3) in CSF were classed as stage 1 and treated with pentamidine. Patients with CSF of {\textgreater} 10 cells/mm(3) were classed as stage 2 and treated with either melarsoprol or eflornithine. We did a retrospective analysis of all patients treated after the September 2002 increase in threshold for classification of HAT disease stage 2, and who were eligible for at least 1 year of follow-up. Primary outcome was survival without death or relapse within 1 year of discharge. Risk factors for treatment failure, in particular CSF white cell count on diagnosis, were assessed.


FINDINGS

Between September 2002 to April 2004, 692 patients eligible for our analysis were treated with pentamidine. All were discharged alive. Relapse rate was 5\% (n = 33). The only identified risk factor for relapse was a CSF white cell count of 6-10 cells/mm(3) rather than 0-5 cells/mm(3) (adjusted hazard ratio 3.27 (95\% confidence interval, 1.52-7.01); P = 0.002).


CONCLUSION

A threshold of 5 white cells/mm(3) in CSF is safer than 10 cells/mm(3) to determine stage 2 HAT and reduce risk of relapse.},

	abstract = {This study was initiated by the laboratories and control department of the French Health Products Safety Agency (AFSSAPS) as part of the fight against the public health problem of rising counterfeit and imitation medicines. To test the discriminating ability of Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS), worse cases scenarios were first considered for the discrimination of various pharmaceutical final products containing the same Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) with different excipients, such as generics of proprietary medicinal products (PMP). Two generic databases were explored: low active strength hard capsules of Fluoxetine and high strength tablets of Ciprofloxacin. Then 4 other cases involving suspicious samples, counterfeits and imitations products were treated. In all these cases, spectral differences between samples were studied, giving access to API or excipient contents information, and eventually allowing manufacturing site identification. A chemometric background is developed to explain the optimisation methodology, consisting in the choices of appropriate pretreatments, algorithms for data exploratory analyses (unsupervised Principal Component Analysis), and data classification (supervised cluster analysis, and Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy). Results demonstrate the high performance of NIRS, highlighting slight differences in formulations, such as 2.5\% (w/w) in API strength, 1.0\% (w/w) in excipient and even coating variations ({\textless}1\%, w/w) with identical contents, approaching the theoretical limits of NIRS sensitivity. All the different generic formulations were correctly discriminated and foreign PMP, constituted of formulations slightly different from the calibration ones, were also all discriminated. This publication addresses the ability of NIRS to detect counterfeits and imitations and presents the NIRS as an ideal tool to master the global threat of counterfeit drugs.},

Its unrestricted use has raised concern about its continued effectiveness. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of miltefosine for the treatment of VL after a decade of use in India. Methods. An open-label, noncomparative study was performed in which 567 patients received oral miltefosine (50 mg for patients weighing {\textless}25 kg, 100 mg in divided doses for those weighing ≥25 kg, and 2.5 mg per kg for those aged {\textless}12 years, daily for 28 days) in a directly observed manner. Patients were followed up for 6 months to see the response to therapy. Results. At the end of treatment the initial cure rate was 97.5\% (intention to treat), and 6 months after the end of treatment the final cure rate was 90.3\%. The overall death rate was 0.9\% (5 of 567), and 2 deaths were related to drug toxicity. Gastrointestinal intolerance was frequent (64.5\%). The drug was interrupted in 9 patients (1.5\%) because of drug-associated adverse events. Conclusions. As compared to the phase III trial that led to registration of the drug a decade ago, there is a substantial increase in the failure rate of oral miltefosine for treatment of VL in India.},

To study the presence of a similar phenomenon in man, frequent measurements of haematological parameters were performed in a series of phase II studies. 70 patients were treated with daily doses of 100-200 mg of the oral formulation of HePC. WBC and platelet counts were performed weekly. In a subgroup of 23 patients serum levels of haemopoietic growth factors were measured before and during treatment. A significant increase in WBC and platelet counts was seen in 74 and 73\% of the patients, respectively. In 4 patients, bone marrow showed normal cellularity, and in 1 patient, bone marrow culture showed normal numbers and sizes of colony forming units. No abnormal levels or trends over time of cytokines were observed. We conclude that oral HePC induces an increase in WBC and platelet counts in the majority of those treated.},

	abstract = {Background. Miltefosine (MIL), the only oral drug for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), is currently the 1(st) line therapy in the VL elimination program of the Indian subcontinent. Given the paucity of anti-VL drugs and the looming threat of resistance, there is an obvious need for close monitoring of clinical efficacy of MIL.Methods. In a cohort study of 120 VL patients treated with MIL in Nepal, we monitored the clinical outcomes up to 12 after completion of therapy and explored the potential role of drug compliance, parasite drug resistance and re-infection.Results. The initial cure rate was 95.8\% (95\% C.I. ±3.6\%)and relapse rate at six and twelve months was 10.8\% (95\% C.I.±5.6\%) and 20.0\% (95\% C.I.±7.2\%) respectively. No significant clinical risk factors of relapse apart from age{\textless}12 years were found. Parasite fingerprints of pre-treatment and relapse bone marrow isolates within 8 patients were similar, suggesting that clinical relapses were not due to re-infection with a new strain. The mean promastigote MIL-susceptibility (IC(50)) of isolates from definite cures was similar to that of relapses. Although more tolerant strains were observed, parasite resistance, as currently measured, is thus not likely involved in MIL treatment failure. Moreover, MIL blood levels at the end of treatment were similar in cured and relapsed patients.Conclusion. Relapse in one fifth of the MIL treated patients observed in our study is an alarming signal for the VL elimination campaign, urging for further review and cohort monitoring.},

An in vitro infection model was used to simulate free pulmonary fluctuating concentrations expected after multiple dosing regimens of both drugs in humans or constant multiples of the minimum inhibitory concentration. PK/PD parameters and PK/PD indices of the simulated dosing regimens were compared. The levofloxacin EC(50) (concentration producing 50\% of the maximum effect) (mean ± standard deviation 3.57±2.16 mg/L) was higher than that for gatifloxacin (0.95±0.56 mg/L) when simulating multiple dosing regimens as well as constant concentrations (EC(50,levofloxacin)=2.75±0.45 mg/L; EC(50,gatifloxacin)=1.03±0.52 mg/L). The maximum killing rate constant (k(max)) was not statistically different for both drugs independent of fluctuating (k(max,levofloxacin)=0.40±0.19 h(-1); k(max,gatifloxacin)=0.48±0.15 h(-1)) or constant concentrations (k(max,levofloxacin)=0.34±0.06 h(-1); k(max,gatifloxacin)=0.39±0.23 h(-1)). The PK/PD model was able to describe the effect of levofloxacin and gatifloxacin against S. pneumoniae in vitro for all the simulations investigated. Gatifloxacin was more potent than levofloxacin, but both presented equivalent efficacy. The model can be used for simulating alternative regimens and optimising therapy to treat streptococcal infextions.},

Unique microsatellite profiles were obtained for all strains from Libo Kemkem. When compared to those of L. donovani strains from different Ethiopian, Kenyan and Sudanese foci, by genetic distance and Bayesian clustering model analyses, most strains from Libo Kemkem grouped with strains from: (i) Humera and Metema in the lowlands and Belessa in the highland of Ethiopia, and (ii) Sudan, at different hierarchal levels. The strains from Libo Kemkem district were assigned at least to three genetically distinct clusters (A, B1 and B2) of which only one, cluster B2, consisted exclusively of strains from Libo Kemkem. The fact that most of the outbreak strains were found to be related to strains from well-known KA foci in northwest Ethiopia and Sudan might suggest multiple introductions of L. donovani strains from these foci into Libo Kemkem district.},

Clinical manifestations are highly variable and cannot be predicted accurately on the basis of the properties of mutant GC. Analysis of secondary abnormalities, such as elevated plasma levels of some hydrolases, may help to increase insight into the complicated pathophysiology of the disease and could also provide useful disease markers. The recent availability of enzyme supplementation therapy for GD increases the need for markers as early predictors of the efficacy of treatment. We report the finding of a very marked increase in chitotrisidase activity in plasma of 30 of 32 symptomatic type 1 GD patients studied: the median activity being {\textgreater} 600 times the median value in plasma of healthy volunteers. In three GC-deficient individuals without clinical symptoms, only slight increases were noted. Chitotriosidase activity was absent in plasma of three control subjects and two patients. During enzyme supplementation therapy, chitotriosidase activity declined dramatically. We conclude that plasma chitotriosidase levels can serve as a new diagnostic hallmark of GD and should prove to be useful in assessing whether clinical manifestations of GD are present and for monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic intervention.},

Unfortunately, research and development in this field is not an economically attractive proposition for the pharmaceutical industry, and this neglect is exacerbated by the fact that many parasitic diseases have negligible profiles in countries that have the funds to research them. An absence of effective vaccines means that, for the foreseeable future, chemotherapy is likely to be the mainstay of disease management. This review describes the advances gained in our understanding of the relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, with the aim of improving the way in which we use antiparasitic agents while at the same time highlighting those areas where there is an urgent need for further investigation. Unsurprisingly, much of our success has been in the chemotherapy of malaria, where the link between drug concentration and response is reasonably well characterised. For many other diseases, however, this link is poorly understood, in some cases because the mechanism of action of the drug has not been fully elucidated, or in other cases because a true pharmacodynamic endpoint may be unavailable. Overcoming these problems is critical if the clinician is to have the information necessary to enable optimal treatment of patients who may be severely ill and in need of immediate, life-saving attention.},

	abstract = {Organisms of the Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) have been demonstrated to be susceptible to moxifloxacin. However, clinical data on how to utilize moxifloxacin to treat disseminated MAC are scanty. In addition, there have been no moxifloxacin pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies performed for MAC infection. We utilized an in vitro PK/PD model of intracellular MAC to study moxifloxacin PK/PD for disseminated disease. Moxifloxacin doses, based on a serum half-life of 12 h, were administered, and the 0- to 24-h area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-24)) to MIC ratios associated with 1.0 log(10) CFU/ml per week kill and 90\% of maximal kill (EC(90)) were identified. The AUC(0-24)/MIC ratio associated with 1.0 log(10) CFU/ml kill was 17.12, and that with EC(90) was 391.56 (r(2) = 0.97). Next, the moxifloxacin MIC distribution in 102 clinical isolates of MAC was identified. The median MIC was 1 to 2 mg/liter. Monte Carlo simulations of 10,000 patients with disseminated MAC were performed to determine the probability that daily moxifloxacin doses of 400 and 800 mg/day would achieve or exceed 1.0 log(10) CFU/ml per week kill or EC(90). Doses of 400 and 800 mg/day achieved the AUC(0-24)/MIC ratio of 17.12 in 64\% and 92\% of patients, respectively. The critical concentration of moxifloxacin against MAC was identified as 0.25 mg/liter in Middlebrook media. The proposed susceptibility breakpoint means that a larger proportion of clinical isolates is resistant to moxifloxacin prior to therapy. For patients infected with susceptible isolates, however, 800 mg a day should be examined for safety and efficacy for disseminated M. avium disease.},

The current dose of moxifloxacin was found to be insufficient for eradication of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria in ventilated patients with severe bronchopneumonia. This can be attributed to the lower tissue penetration observed in this population. Increasing the dose to 600 mg was able to achieve higher levels of free drug AUC/MIC in both bronchial and plasma compartments. In AECB, moxifloxacin achieved the same AUC/MIC values observed in pneumonia at the different MIC values.

	abstract = {Drug resistance has emerged as a major impediment in the treatment of leishmaniasis. Alkyl-lysophospholipids (ALP), originally developed as anticancer drugs, are considered to be the most promising antileishmanial agents. In order to anticipate probable clinical failure in the near future, we have investigated possible mechanisms of resistance to these drugs in Leishmania spp. The results presented here support the involvement of a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, the Leishmania P-glycoprotein-like transporter, in the resistance to ALP. (i) First, a multidrug resistance (MDR) Leishmania tropica line overexpressing a P-glycoprotein-like transporter displays significant cross-resistance to the ALP miltefosine and edelfosine, with resistant indices of 9.2- and 7.1-fold, respectively. (ii) Reduced expression of P-glycoprotein in the MDR line correlates with a significant decrease in ALP resistance. (iii) The ALP were able to modulate the P-glycoprotein-mediated resistance to daunomycin in the MDR line. (iv) We have found a new inhibitor of this transporter, the sesquiterpene C-3, that completely sensitizes MDR parasites to ALP. (v) Finally, the MDR line exhibits a lower accumulation than the wild-type line of bodipy-C(5)-PC, a fluorescent analogue of phosphatidylcholine that has a structure resembling that of edelfosine. Also, C-3 significantly increases the accumulation of the fluorescent analogue to levels similar to those of wild-type parasites. The involvement of the Leishmania P-glycoprotein-like transporter in resistance to drugs used in the treatment of leishmaniasis also supports the importance of developing new specific inhibitors of this ABC transporter.},

The presenting signs and symptoms of leishmaniasis were those commonly seen in the visceral form of the disease, particularly in Kenya. At termination, clinical cures were achieved in all 53 patients with no difference between treatment groups. Spleen aspirates revealed the best parasitological results in patients receiving the combined treatment, with only 13\% failures (partial cures + relapses), as opposed to 21\% failures with aminosidine alone and 45\% with stibogluconate alone. Treatment with aminosidine alone was the cheapest and safest regime.},

	abstract = {Following resurgence in Bihar of epidemic kala-azar, outbreaks of the disease were identified simultaneously in two separate foci about 500 km apart in West Bengal in 1980. While the outbreak in one of these foci, in northern West Bengal, was the result of a direct extension of the Bihar epidemic, the source of parasite in the other (in the village of Bandipur in the south of West Bengal) remained unknown until a case of nodulo-ulcerative post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) was located in the village. The continued presence of this case in the village from a time long before the outbreak aroused strong suspicion about its causal role. Laboratory-bred female Phlebotomus argentipes sandflies were allowed to feed on four cases of PKDL, including the case from Bandipur, to determine the transmission potential of these cases. Of a total of 400 flies in the experiment, 104 (26\%) fed on the cases, and of these flies 44 died (31 within 48 hours of feeding). Of the surviving 60 flies, 32 developed promastigotes in the mid-gut. In view of the presence of the case of PKDL in the village prior to the outbreak and the availability of a susceptible human population and vectors, it is possible that the patient with PKDL was a source of Leishmania donovani parasites for the local focus. Furthermore, PKDL may act as a reservoir of parasites during inter-epidemic periods.},

	abstract = {Pentavalent antimony complexes, such as sodium stibogluconate and sodium antimony gluconate (SAG), are still the first choice for chemotherapy against various forms of leishmaniasis, including visceral leishmaniasis, or kala-azar. Although the requirement of a somewhat functional immune system for the antileishmanial action of antimony was reported previously, the cellular and molecular mechanism of action of SAG was not clear. Herein, we show that SAG induces extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK-1) and ERK-2 phosphorylation through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase C, and Ras activation and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation through PI3K and Akt activation. ERK-1 and ERK-2 activation results in an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 3 to 6 h after SAG treatment, while p38 MAPK activation and subsequent tumor necrosis factor alpha release result in the production of nitric oxide (NO) 24 h after SAG treatment. Thus, this study has provided the first evidence that SAG treatment induces activation of some important components of the intracellular signaling pathway, which results in an early wave of ROS-dependent parasite killing and a stronger late wave of NO-dependent parasite killing. This opens up the possibility of this metalloid chelate being used in the treatment of various diseases either alone or in combination with other drugs and vaccines.},

	volume = {60},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: HIV protease inhibitors (HPIs) are an important component of highly active antiretroviral therapy. However, the activity of drug efflux transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP1/MRP2), may limit intracellular drug accumulation. Drugs that inhibit the activity of drug efflux proteins may, in combination with HPIs, enhance the clinical efficacy of the drugs. METHODS: The transport of [(14)C]lopinavir was evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the absence or presence of known inhibitors: tariquidar (P-gp), MK571 (MRP), frusemide (MRP1/2), dipyridamole (MRP1/P-gp) and probenecid (MRP2/OATP). The effects of ritonavir, amprenavir and atazanavir on the accumulation of lopinavir were also evaluated in cultured CD4(+) T-lymphoblastoid cells [CEM (parental), CEM(VBL) (P-gp-overexpressing) and CEM(E1000) (MRP1-overexpressing)] and PBMCs. The relative expression of the drug efflux proteins on the PBMCs was assessed by flow cytometric and real-time PCR methods. RESULTS: Tariquidar, MK571, frusemide and dipyridamole all significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of lopinavir in the PBMCs, whereas probenecid decreased it. The cellular accumulation ratio (CAR) of lopinavir was also increased by ritonavir, amprenavir and atazanavir in a concentration-dependent manner in both cell types. The expression of P-gp, MRP1 and MRP2 mRNA were variable and individually did not correlate with CARs of lopinavir. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that lopinavir is a substrate of P-gp, MRP1 and MRP2. The intracellular concentration of lopinavir is increased when co-incubated with ritonavir, amprenavir and atazanavir in PBMCs. Manipulation of drug efflux transporters may be a useful strategy for increasing the intracellular concentration and thereby enhancing the clinical efficacy of lopinavir.},

New and better treatment options are urgently needed in disease endemic areas due to the long courses, toxicity and development of resistance to current treatments. Recently, the antibiotic paromomycin was tested and registered in India to treat this disease. The current study describes a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of injectable paromomycin, either alone or in combination with the standard drug sodium stibogluconate in three East African countries—Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia. The study showed that at the same paromomycin dose that was successfully used and registered in India, a far poorer outcome was obtained, particularly in Sudan, suggesting that there are either differences in the patients ability to respond to the drug or in the susceptibility of parasites in East Africa compared with those in India. However, no major safety concerns were noted with the treatment. Further research was initiated to see if a higher dose of paromomycin would perform better, especially in Sudan. The results of this and the performance of the combination arm will be reported later. Our study highlights the importance of considering geographical differences to treatment responses.},

	abstract = {Selecting, evaluating and applying biomarkers in drug discovery and exploratory drug development do substantially shorten the time to reach a critical decision point. Biomarkers are most useful in the early phase of clinical development when measurement of clinical endpoints or true surrogates may be too time-consuming or cumbersome to provide timely proof of principle or dose-ranging information. The use of biomarkers in early drug development helps to streamline clinical development by determining whether the drug is reaching and affecting the molecular target in humans, delivering findings that are comparable to preclinical data, and by providing a measurable endpoint that predicts desired or undesired clinical effects. Critical decisions such as candidate selection, early proof of mechanism or proof of concept, dose ranging and patient stratification as well as the assessment of development risks regarding safety, toxicity and drug interactions can be based on measurement of appropriate biomarkers that are biologically and/or clinically validated. Preclinical and phase I development plans can be focused to support an early s.d. or m.d. biomarker study in healthy volunteers or mildly diseased patients, thus saving both resources and time. Dose estimates and patient stratification may reduce the size and duration of clinical studies in later phases of development, and safety and toxicity biomarkers may help to stop or continue a programme early on. Even if a biomarker fails in the validation process there may still be a benefit of having used it as more knowledge about pathophysiology of the disease and the drug may be obtained. Thus, appropriateness of biomarkers depends on the stage of development, development strategy and the medical indication. Examples of biomarkers in exploratory clinical development are given for the development of new drugs in various indications.},

Transient HePC treatment of Leishmania donovani promastigotes at 10 microM significantly reduced the phosphatidylcholine content and enhanced the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) content in parasite membranes, suggesting a partial inactivation of PE-N-methyltransferase. Phospholipase D activity did not seem to be affected by HePC. In addition, the enhancement of the lysophosphatidylcholine content could be ascribed to phospholipase A2 activation. Moreover, transient HePC treatment had no effect on the fatty acid alkyl chain length or the fatty acid unsaturation rate. Concerning sterols, we found a strong reduction of the C24 alkylated sterol content, and the enhancement of the cholesterol content could be the result of the HePC condensation effect with sterols. Because some of the effects observed after transient HePC treatment were different from those previously observed in HePC-resistant parasites, it could be hypothesized that continuous in vitro drug pressure induces the mechanisms of regulation in Leishmania lipid metabolism.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide data about wealth distribution in visceral leishmaniasis (VL)-affected communities compared to that of the general population of Bihar State, India.
METHODS: After extensive disease risk mapping, 16 clusters with high VL transmission were selected in Bihar. An exhaustive census of all households in the clusters was conducted and socio-economic household characteristics were documented by questionnaire. Data on the general Bihar population taken from the National Family Health Survey of India were used for comparison. An asset index was developed based on Principal Components Analysis and the distribution of this asset index for the VL communities was compared with that of the general population of Bihar.
RESULTS: 83\% of households in communities with high VL attack rates belonged to the two lowest quintiles of the Bihar wealth distribution. All socio-economic indicators showed significantly lower wealth for those households.
CONCLUSION: Visceral leishmaniasis clearly affects the poorest of the poor in India. They are most vulnerable, as this vector-born disease is linked to poor housing and unhealthy habitats. The disease leads the affected households to more destitution because of its impact on household income and wealth. Support for the present VL elimination initiative is important in the fight against poverty.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The commonly used antileishmanial drugs are sodium antimony gluconate (SAG), amphotericin B, miltefosine and paromomycin. There are a number of reports that antileishmanial drugs show immunomodulatory properties. Here, we attempt to understand how the innate arm of the immune system is modulated in response to these antileishmanial drugs.
METHODS: BALB/c peritoneal macrophages were treated with miltefosine, SAG, amphotericin B or paromomycin. The membrane fluidity of macrophages following drug treatment was studied in terms of fluorescence anisotropy. The T cell-stimulating ability, production of cytokines and nitrogen and oxygen metabolite production in drug-treated macrophages were also studied. The study was also carried out using peritoneal macrophages from drug-treated BALB/c mice.
RESULTS: The antileishmanial drugs altered macrophage membrane fluidity, except amphotericin B. The drug-treated macrophages showed enhanced T cell-stimulating ability and generation of reactive oxygen species, nitrite, interleukin-12 and tumour necrosis factor-α.
CONCLUSIONS: Antileishmanial drugs can stimulate the innate arm of the immune system, which may have a significant bearing on the cellular arm of the immune system.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a major public health problem in Bihar, accounting for 90\% of all cases in India. Development of high levels of resistance to various existing drugs necessitated the search for alternative orally administered drugs. Hospital-based studies have shown that oral miltefosine is a highly effective treatment for VL both in adults and in children.
METHODS: An open, single-arm trial was designed to investigate the feasibility of treatment of VL patients with miltefosine in field conditions in 13 centers in Bihar.
RESULTS: The phase 4 study was conducted among 1132 adult and pediatric VL patients. Compliance was good, with 1084 (95.5\%) patients completing the full 28-day treatment course. Nine hundred and seventy-one (85.8\%) patients returned for the final cure assessment at 6 months after treatment. The final cure rate was 82\% by intention to treat analysis and 95\% by per protocol analysis (similar to the 94\% cure rate in hospitalized patients). Treatment-related adverse events of common toxicity criteria grade 3 occurred in {\textasciitilde}3\% of patients, including gastrointestinal toxicity and rise in aspertate amino transferase, alanine amino transferase, or serum creatinine levels, similar to previous clinical experience.
CONCLUSION: This study supports the use of miltefosine in an outpatient setting in an area where VL is endemic.},

This study was undertaken to identify novel Leishmania donovani antigens to solve the existing problem. The soluble L. donovani promastigote antigen was separated by SDS-PAGE, and a Western blot was probed with pooled sera of five subjects with confirmed VL before (n = 9 pools) and after (n = 9 pools) treatment and at the 6-month follow-up visit (n = 9 pools), healthy controls not from an area of endemicity (n = 9 pools), and healthy controls from an area of endemicity. The antibody response to the identified partially purified antigen was ascertained by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with 70 sera from patients with parasitologically confirmed VL, 48 sera from healthy controls from an area where the disease is not endemic, 60 sera from healthy controls from an area of endemicity, and 42 sera from patients in different disease groups. The eluted protein was subjected to two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis, Western blotted, and probed with sera from patients with confirmed VL and from healthy controls not from an area of endemicity. The antigenic protein was further characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The identified protein (BHUP2) corresponds to a cytochrome c-like synthesis protein of 37 kDa. ELISA results were 94\% sensitive, whereas specificities with sera from healthy controls from an area of endemicity, healthy controls not from an area of endemicity, and disease controls were 98\%, 100\%, and 97\%, respectively.

METHODS: A Monte Carlo simulation involving 10000 subjects was used to analyze the pharmacokinetic parameters and microbiological data of linezolid for an effectiveness evaluation at the corresponding AUC24/MIC values (area under the serum concentration-time curve over 24h/minimum inhibitory concentration).
RESULTS: As the PK/PD index of linezolid increased from 80 to 120, the corresponding probability of target attainment (PTA) decreased from 99.91\% to 18.97\%, with a MIC of 2mg/l. Furthermore, the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) reached {\textless}90\% for several pathogens at an AUC24/MIC of 100-120, revealing a relatively lower efficacy with recommended linezolid dosing.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that the target AUC24/MIC value of 80-120 requires further classification for more accurate assessment of the linezolid dose regimen. At a MIC of ≥2mg/l, the clinical outcome varies greatly for different AUC24/MIC values when applying the same dose of linezolid. In such cases, we suggest optimized adjustment of the linezolid dosage regimen.},

For 10 years it has been licensed in India for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a fatal neglected parasitic disease.

The standard 28 day miltefosine monotherapy regimen is well tolerated, except for mild gastrointestinal side effects, although its teratogenic potential severely hampers its general use in the clinic and roll-out in national elimination programmes. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine are mainly characterized by its long residence time in the body, resulting in extensive drug accumulation during treatment and long elimination half-lives. At the moment, different combination therapy strategies encompassing miltefosine are being tested in multiple controlled clinical trials in various geographical areas of endemicity, both in South Asia and East Africa. We here review the most salient pre-clinical and clinical pharmacological aspects of miltefosine, its mechanism of action against Leishmania parasites and other pathogens, and provide a systematic overview of the efficacy and safety data from all clinical trials of miltefosine, either alone or in combination, in the treatment of VL and CL.},

Little is known about the pharmacokinetics ofmiltefosine; an important characteristic is its long elimination half-life of seven days or longer. The most frequent adverse effects are of gastrointestinal origin. Miltefosine should not be used during pregnancy. Over thirty leishmaniasis patients have already been treated with miltefosine in the Netherlands.},

	abstract = {Over the past 50 years, a decline in the quality of semen has been observed, possibly resulting in a reduction in male fertility. Among the factors affecting semen quality, exposure to drugs is of particular importance. It is known that drugs can be transported to the seminal plasma, which is made up of secretions from the various accessory genital glands. There is evidence that many drugs enter the male genitourinary tract by an ion-trapping process. Lipid solubility and the degree of ionisation of the drug, which depend on the pH of plasma and seminal fluid, are important factors in this process. To date, few studies have been conducted on this topic. Pharmacokinetic evaluation of the fluids of the male accessory gland have been performed in the case of chloroquine and caffeine only, while the effects of mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid), sulfasalazine, salicylate, propranolol, diltiazem, flunarizine, verapamil, caffeine and nicotine on sperm physiology and morphology have been examined. Although data from the literature are scarce and incomplete, it is evident that many drugs can be excreted into semen. These drugs may interfere with the most common semen characteristics, potentially resulting in a male-mediated teratogenic effect, or local and systemic responses in female recipients. Therefore, it may be advisable to include, in the processes of drug development, pharmacokinetic evaluation of a drug in the semen and analysis of standard microscopic parameters of the semen. This is particularly important for drugs known to concentrate in the semen.},

	abstract = {The use of liposomes in the treatment of severe infections is under investigation. Classical liposomes which localize in cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) can be exploited in two ways. First for targeting of macrophage modulators such as muramyl peptides or IFN-gamma, to stimulate the cells of the MPS to maximal blood clearance capacity. This enhanced nonspecific anti-infectious resistance is important as in immunocompromised patients micro-organisms frequently appear in the blood from a local infection. Secondly, classical liposomes are successfully used as carriers of antibiotics in experimental intracellular parasitic-, viral-, fungal- or bacterial infections in MPS tissues. Based on these data extensive studies in patients with severe fungal infections have demonstrated successful treatment with liposomal or lipid-complexed amphotericin B. More recently, liposomal amphotericin B appeared to be effective in patients with drug-resistant visceral leishmaniasis. For the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex infection in AIDS patients the efficacy of liposomal gentamicin is under investigation. With respect to infections in non-MPS tissues the applicability of Stealth liposomes characterized by long circulation half-lives is under investigation. Substantial localization of these liposomes in infected lung tissue of rats was demonstrated. Preliminary data in experimental bacterial lung infection showed superior efficacy of antibiotic encapsulated in Stealth liposomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti-leishmanial drug regimens that include a single dose AmBisome could be suitable for eastern African patients with symptomatic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) but the appropriate single dose is unknown.
METHODOLOGY: A multi-centre, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial with an adaptive design, was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of a single dose and multiple doses of AmBisome for the treatment of VL in eastern Africa. The primary efficacy endpoint was definitive cure (DC) at 6 months. Symptomatic patients with parasitologically-confirmed, non-severe VL, received a single dose of AmBisome 7.5 mg/kg body weight or multiple doses, 7 times 3 mg/kg on days 1-5, 14, and 21. If interim analyses, evaluated 30 days after the start of treatment following 40 or 80 patients, showed the single dose gave significantly poorer parasite clearance than multiple doses at the 5\% significance level, the single dose was increased by 2·5 mg/kg. In a sub-set of patients, parasite clearance was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT) PCR.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The trial was terminated after the third interim analysis because of low efficacy of both regimens. Based on the intention-to-treat population, DC was 85\% (95\%CI 73-93\%), 40\% (95\%CI 19-64\%), and 58\% (95\%CI 41-73\%) in patients treated with multiple doses (n = 63), and single doses of 7·5 (n = 21) or 10 mg/kg (n = 40), respectively. qRT-PCR suggested superior parasite clearance with multiple doses as early as day 3. Safety data accorded with the drug label.
CONCLUSIONS: The tested AmBisome regimens would not be suitable for VL treatment across eastern Africa. An optimal single dose regimen was not identified.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide data about wealth distribution in visceral leishmaniasis (VL)-affected communities compared to that of the general population of Bihar State, India.
METHODS: After extensive disease risk mapping, 16 clusters with high VL transmission were selected in Bihar. An exhaustive census of all households in the clusters was conducted and socio-economic household characteristics were documented by questionnaire. Data on the general Bihar population taken from the National Family Health Survey of India were used for comparison. An asset index was developed based on Principal Components Analysis and the distribution of this asset index for the VL communities was compared with that of the general population of Bihar.
RESULTS: 83\% of households in communities with high VL attack rates belonged to the two lowest quintiles of the Bihar wealth distribution. All socio-economic indicators showed significantly lower wealth for those households.
CONCLUSION: Visceral leishmaniasis clearly affects the poorest of the poor in India. They are most vulnerable, as this vector-born disease is linked to poor housing and unhealthy habitats. The disease leads the affected households to more destitution because of its impact on household income and wealth. Support for the present VL elimination initiative is important in the fight against poverty.},

H. influenzae 3113 was exposed to PD-0162819 concentrations of 0.5 to 16× the MIC (MIC = 0.125 μg/ml) and area-under-the-curve (AUC)/MIC ratios of 1 to 1,100 in SCTK and chemostat experiments, respectively. Serial samples were collected over 24 h. For efficacy driver analysis, a sigmoid maximum-effect (E(max)) model was fitted to the relationship between bacterial density changes over 24 h and corresponding PK/PD indices. A semimechanistic PK/PD model describing the time course of bacterial growth and death was developed. The AUC/MIC ratio best explained efficacy (r(2) = 0.95) compared to the peak drug concentration (C(max))/MIC ratio (r(2) = 0.76) and time above the MIC (T{\textgreater}MIC) (r(2) = 0.88). Static effects and 99.9\% killing were achieved at AUC/MIC values of 500 and 600, respectively. For time course analysis, the net bacterial growth rate constant, maximum bacterial density, and maximum kill rate constant were similar in SCTK and chemostat studies, but PD-0162819 was more potent in SCTK than in the chemostat (50\% effective concentration [EC(50)] = 0.046 versus 0.34 μg/ml). In conclusion, basic PK/PD relationships for PD-0162819 were established using in vitro dynamic systems. Although the bacterial growth parameters and maximum drug effects were similar in SCTK and the chemostat system, PD-0162819 appeared to be more potent in SCTK, illustrating the importance of understanding the differences in preclinical models. Additional studies are needed to determine the in vivo relevance of these results.},

METHODS: Patients with measurable metastatic STS received perifosine as first-, second-, or third-line treatment and underwent disease assessment every 8 weeks until disease progression, excessive toxicity, or patient refusal. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients received 66 cycles (1 cycle = 4 weeks) of perifosine. One partial response of 9 months duration was observed. The overall 3 and 6 month progression-free survival was 22\% and 9\%. NCI CTC (v2.0) Grade 1 to 2 gastrointestinal toxicity or fatigue were the most common ({\textgreater}50\% of subjects) toxicities observed. The steady-state plasma perifosine levels (Css) were similar to prior experience (mean 6 microg/mL). Patients with Css levels {\textgreater}6 microg/mL appeared more likely to remain on study past 2 months than those with levels {\textless}6 microg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Despite not achieving the primary objective of {\textgreater} or =40\% 6-month progression-free survival rate, optimism remains for this agent in STS patients. Prolonged responses in heavily pretreated STS patients continue to be observed with perifosine treatment. Continued assessment of perifosine in STS appears warranted, with special attention to specific histologies or tumor characteristics that might identify a more sensitive population and achieving perifosine Css levels {\textgreater}6 microg/mL.},

On the other hand, the best results for the Cialis samples were provided by the combination of NIR and Raman spectroscopy (1400-1190 cm(-1)). These techniques not only permitted a clear discrimination between genuine and counterfeit or imitation samples but also the distinction of clusters among illegal samples.

Objectives: To describe the pharmacokinetics and establish a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship for miltefosine in Eastern African patients with visceral leishmaniasis, using a time-to-event approach to model relapse of disease.
Methods: Miltefosine plasma concentrations from 95 patients (48 monotherapy versus 47 combination therapy) were included in the population pharmacokinetic model using non-linear mixed effects modelling. Subsequently a time-to-event model was developed to model the time of clinical relapse. Various summary pharmacokinetic parameters (various AUCs, Time {\textgreater} EC50, Time {\textgreater} EC90), normalized within each treatment arm to allow simultaneous analysis, were evaluated as relapse hazard-changing covariates.
Results: A two-compartment population model with first-order absorption fitted the miltefosine pharmacokinetic data adequately. Relative bioavailability was reduced (-74\%, relative standard error 4.7\%) during the first week of treatment of the monotherapy arm but only the first day of the shorter combination regimen. Time to the relapse of infection could be described using a constant baseline hazard (baseline 1.8 relapses/year, relative standard error 72.7\%). Miltefosine Time {\textgreater} EC90 improved the model significantly when added in a maximum effect function on the baseline hazard (half maximal effect with Time {\textgreater} EC90 6.97 days for monotherapy).
Conclusions: Miltefosine drug exposure was found to be decreased in Eastern African patients with visceral leishmaniasis, due to a (transient) initial lower bioavailability. Relapse hazard was inversely linked to miltefosine exposure. Significantly lower miltefosine exposure was observed in children compared with adults, further urging the need for implementation of dose adaptations for children.},

However, the literature on steroids is more limited than that on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). To estimate the risk of upper gastrointestinal complications associated with use of steroids alone and in combination, a nested case-control analysis was conducted on the General Practice Research Database from the United KINGDOM: The authors identified 2,105 cases of upper gastrointestinal complications and 11,500 controls between 1993 and 1998. The adjusted odds ratios associated with current use of oral steroids were 1.8 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 2.4) for upper gastrointestinal complications overall and 2.4 (95\% CI: 1.7, 3.4) for gastric and 1.2 (95\% CI: 0.8, 1.9) for duodenal damage. Steroids were similarly associated with bleeding (odds ratio (OR) = 1.8; 95\% CI: 1.3, 2.4) and perforations (OR = 1.6; 95\% CI: 0.9, 3.1). Simultaneous use of steroids with low-medium and high NSAID doses, respectively, produced odds ratios of 4.0 (95\% CI: 1.3, 12.0) and 12.7 (95\% CI: 6.2, 26.1), compared with users of none. Whenever possible, antiinflammatory drugs should be given in monotherapy and at the lowest effective dose in order to reduce the risk of upper gastrointestinal complications.},

	abstract = {The plausible mechanism by which dexamethasone makes the gastric mucosa susceptible to ulceration has been studied. As acid aggravates ulcer, the role of dexamethasone on acid secretion was first investigated. Dexamethasone stimulates both basal and drug (mercaptomethylimidazole)-induced gastric acid secretion by 100 and 50\% respectively in male Wister rats 24 h after intramuscular administration at the dose of 1 mg/kg body wt. This stimulated acid secretion is 93\% blocked by cimetidine indicating increased liberation of histamine in the process. Pretreatment of dexamethasone before 24 h produces ulcer in 30\% of the pylorus- ligated rats and aggravates the ulcer index by 82\% in both pylorus and esophagus ligated rats. The incidence of ulceration in the latter cases is also increased by 25\%. As mucosal prostaglandin synthetase and peroxidase play an important role in gastroprotection through biosynthesis of prostaglandin and by scavenging endogenous H2O2 respectively, the effect of dexamethasone on the activities of these gastroprotective enzymes were studied. Prostaglandin synthetase and peroxidase activities of the mucosa are significantly inhibited by 87 and 83\% respectively by 24-h pretreatment with dexamethasone. The results indicate that dexamethasone makes the mucosa prone to ulceration by inhibiting the activity of prostaglandin synthetase to block the gastroprotective action of prostaglandin and also by inhibiting the peroxidase, thereby elevating the endogenous H2O2 level to generate more reactive hydroxyl radical responsible for the mucosal damage.},

Widespread availability of monotherapies and falsified antimalarials is thought to have contributed to the historical development of multidrug-resistant malaria in Cambodia. This study aimed to document the quality of artemisinin-containing antimalarials (ACAs) and to compare two methods of collecting antimalarials from drug outlets: through open surveyors and mystery clients (MCs). Few oral artemisinin-based monotherapies and no suspected falsified medicines were found. All 291 samples contained the stated active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of which 69\% were considered good quality by chemical analysis. Overall, medicine quality did not differ by collection method, although open surveyors were less likely to obtain oral artemisinin-based monotherapies than MCs. The results are an encouraging indication of the positive impact of the country's efforts to tackle falsified antimalarials and artemisinin-based monotherapies. However, poor-quality medicines remain an ongoing challenge that demands sustained political will and investment of human and financial resources.},

	abstract = {AIM: The aim was to investigate the population pharmacokinetics of levamisole in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome.
METHODS: Non-linear mixed effects modelling was performed on samples collected during a randomized controlled trial. Samples were collected from children who were receiving 2.5 mg kg(-1) levamisole (or placebo) orally once every other day. One hundred and thirty-six plasma samples were collected from 38 children from India and Europe and included in the analysis. A one compartment model described the data well.
RESULTS: The apparent clearance rate (CL/F) and distribution volume (V/F) were 44 l h(-1) 70 kg(-1) and 236 l 70 kg(-1) , respectively; estimated interindividual variability was 32-42\%. In addition to allometric scaling of CL/F and V/F to body weight, we identified a significant proportional effect of age on CL/F (-10.1\% per year). The pharmacokinetics parameters were not affected by gender, tablet strength or study centre. The median (interquartile range) maximum plasma concentration of levamisole was 438.3 (316.5-621.8) ng ml(-1) , and the median area under the concentration-time curve was 2847 (2267-3761) ng ml(-1) h. Median tmax and t½ values were 1.65 (1.32-2.0) h and 2.60 (2.06-3.65) h, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we present the first pharmacokinetic data regarding levamisole in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. The pharmacokinetic profile of levamisole in children was similar to findings reported in adults, although the elimination rate was slightly higher in children.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alternative treatments for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) are required in East Africa. Paromomycin sulphate (PM) has been shown to be efficacious for VL treatment in India.
METHODS: A multi-centre randomized-controlled trial (RCT) to compare efficacy and safety of PM (20 mg/kg/day for 21 days) and PM plus sodium stibogluconate (SSG) combination (PM, 15 mg/kg/day and SSG, 20 mg/kg/day for 17 days) with SSG (20 mg/kg/day for 30 days) for treatment of VL in East Africa. Patients aged 4-60 years with parasitologically confirmed VL were enrolled, excluding patients with contraindications. Primary and secondary efficacy outcomes were parasite clearance at 6-months follow-up and end of treatment, respectively. Safety was assessed mainly using adverse event (AE) data.
FINDINGS: The PM versus SSG comparison enrolled 205 patients per arm with primary efficacy data available for 198 and 200 patients respectively. The SSG \& PM versus SSG comparison enrolled 381 and 386 patients per arm respectively, with primary efficacy data available for 359 patients per arm. In Intention-to-Treat complete-case analyses, the efficacy of PM was significantly lower than SSG (84.3\% versus 94.1\%, difference = 9.7\%, 95\% confidence interval, CI: 3.6 to 15.7\%, p = 0.002). The efficacy of SSG \& PM was comparable to SSG (91.4\% versus 93.9\%, difference = 2.5\%, 95\% CI: -1.3 to 6.3\%, p = 0.198). End of treatment efficacy results were very similar. There were no apparent differences in the safety profile of the three treatment regimens.
CONCLUSION: The 17 day SSG \& PM combination treatment had a good safety profile and was similar in efficacy to the standard 30 day SSG treatment, suggesting suitability for VL treatment in East Africa.

Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to simulate the PK/PD indices of the investigated antimicrobials. The probability of target attainment (PTA) was estimated at minimum inhibitory concentration values ranging from 0.03 to 32 μg/mL to define the PK/PD susceptibility breakpoints. The cumulative fraction of response (CFR) was computed using minimum inhibitory concentration data from the Canadian National Intensive Care Unit study. Analysis of the simulation results suggested the breakpoints of 4 μg/mL for ceftobiprole (500 mg/2 h t.i.d.), 0.25 μg/mL for dalbavancin (1000 mg), 0.12 μg/mL for daptomycin (4 mg/kg q.d. and 6 mg/kg q.d.) and tigecycline (50 mg b.i.d.), and 2 μg/mL for linezolid (600 mg b.i.d.) and vancomycin (1 g b.i.d. and 1.5 g b.i.d.).

Analysis of the effect of edelfosine, ilmofosine and miltefosine on Leishmania amazonensis and of potential targets of these lysophospholipid analogues.


METHODS

Quantification and ultrastructural analysis of the effect of lysophospholipid analogues on promastigote forms and on infected peritoneal macrophages, and flow cytometry analysis of treated promastigotes labelled with propidium iodide and rhodamine 123 (Rh123).


RESULTS

The lysophospholipid analogues presented potent antiproliferative activity with IC50/3 days of 1.9-3.4 microM for promastigotes and 4.2-9.0 microM for intracellular amastigotes. Treatment with these analogues in Schneider medium for 1 day led to a dose-dependent decrease in Rh123 fluorescence, an effect more accentuated in edelfosine-treated parasites, suggesting interference with the potential of the mitochondrial membrane. In both forms of L. amazonensis, edelfosine induced extensive mitochondrial damage, multinucleation and, in promastigotes, also led to plasma membrane alterations, formation of autophagic structures and membranous arrangements inside the flagellar pocket.


CONCLUSIONS

The alkylglycerophosphocholines edelfosine and ilmofosine were more active than the alkylphosphocholine miltefosine against promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes of L. amazonensis, and ultrastructural and flow cytometry data indicate the mitochondrion as a target of edelfosine.},

	abstract = {The latex agglutination test (KAtex), direct agglutination test (DAT), and the rK39 immuno-chromatographic strip test (dipstick test) were evaluated for their role in the diagnosis and prognosis of visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) in India. Sera and urine samples from 455 subjects--150 confirmed visceral leishmaniasis cases, 160 endemic controls, 100 non-endemic controls, and 45 other febrile diseases--were included in the study. The sensitivity of the KAtex, DAT, and rK39 strip test was 87\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) 80-96], 93.3\% (95\% CI 88-100), and 98\% (95\% CI 93-100) respectively. The specificity of these tests was 98\% (95\% CI 93-100), 93\% (95\% CI 87-100), and 89\% (95\% CI 82-97) for the KAtex, DAT, and rK39 strip test respectively. Fifty cases were followed up and subjected to the KAtex, DAT, and rK39 strip test after 30 days of successful treatment. The DAT and rK39 strip test showed positive results in all the 50 cases whereas the KAtex showed no positive reaction in any case. Based on the results, it is concluded that the sensitivity and specificity of the DAT and rK39 strip test are comparable but the greater convenience of use of the strip test makes it a better tool for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in the peripheral areas of endemic regions whereas the sensitivity of the KAtex needs to be improved to promote its use as a first-line diagnostic test in the field-setting. It may be used for the prognosis of the disease as antigen becomes undetectable in urine after 30 days of the completion of the treatment. Alternatively, it can be used as an adjunct with rK39 for sero-epidemiological surveys.},

Reduction of gastric acid secretion by acid-suppressive therapy allows pathogen colonization from the upper gastrointestinal tract. The bacteria and viruses in the contaminated stomach have been identified as species from the oral cavity.


OBJECTIVE

To examine the association between the use of acid-suppressive drugs and occurrence of community-acquired pneumonia.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS

Incident acid-suppressive drug users with at least 1 year of valid database history were identified from the Integrated Primary Care Information database between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2002. Incidence rates for pneumonia were calculated for unexposed and exposed individuals. To reduce confounding by indication, a case-control analysis was conducted nested in a cohort of incident users of acid-suppressive drugs. Cases were all individuals with incident pneumonia during or after stopping use of acid-suppressive drugs. Up to 10 controls were matched to each case for practice, year of birth, sex, and index date. Conditional logistic regression was used to compare the risk of community-acquired pneumonia between use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE

Community-acquired pneumonia defined as certain (proven by radiography or sputum culture) or probable (clinical symptoms consistent with pneumonia).


RESULTS

The study population comprised 364,683 individuals who developed 5551 first occurrences of pneumonia during follow-up. The incidence rates of pneumonia in non-acid-suppressive drug users and acid-suppressive drug users were 0.6 and 2.45 per 100 person-years, respectively. The adjusted relative risk for pneumonia among persons currently using PPIs compared with those who stopped using PPIs was 1.89 (95\% confidence interval, 1.36-2.62). Current users of H2-receptor antagonists had a 1.63-fold increased risk of pneumonia (95\% confidence interval, 1.07-2.48) compared with those who stopped use. For current PPI users, a significant positive dose-response relationship was observed. For H2-receptor antagonist users, the variation in dose was restricted.


CONCLUSION

Current use of gastric acid-suppressive therapy was associated with an increased risk of community-acquired pneumonia.},

There are significant differences in the sensitivity of these species both to the standard drugs, for example, pentavalent antimonials and miltefosine, and those on clinical trial, for example, paromomycin. Over 60\% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis in Bihar State, India, do not respond to treatment with pentavalent antimonials. This is now considered to be due to acquired resistance. Although this class of drugs has been used for over 60 years for leishmaniasis treatment, it is only in the past 2 years that the mechanisms of action and resistance have been identified, related to drug metabolism, thiol metabolism, and drug efflux. With the introduction of new therapies, including miltefosine in 2002 and paromomycin in 2005-2006, it is essential that there be a strategy to prevent the emergence of resistance to new drugs; combination therapy, monitoring of therapy, and improved diagnostics could play an essential role in this strategy.},

Both data from indirect (clinical data) and direct life-span measurement (biotin-labeled data) methods were analyzed using non-linear mixed effects models. Analysis showed that: (1) predictions from non-steady state data will depend on the RBC model chosen; (2) the transit compartment model, which considers variation in life-span in the RBC population, better describes RBC survival data than the random destruction or homogenous life-span models; and (3) the additional incorporation of random destruction patterns, although improving the description of the RBC survival data, does not appear to provide a marked improvement when describing clinical data.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

The Intermountain Cystic Fibrosis Pediatric Center utilizes ticarcillin-clavulanate 400 mg/kg/d divided every 6 hours, (maximum 24 g/d). This dosing strategy is higher than the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved package labeling. We evaluated the microbiologic efficacy of this dosing regimen.


OBJECTIVES

The primary study objective was to predict the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) MIC breakpoints (the highest MIC with a probability of target attainment [PTA] of at least 90\%) for the bacteriostatic and bactericidal targets of ticarcillin activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the study dosing regimen. A secondary objective was to evaluate the tolerability profile of the higher ticarcillin-clavulanate dosing regimen in children with cystic fibrosis (CF).


METHODS

This was a population-based PK-PD modeling study of pediatric CF patients admitted from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2009 who received the dosing regimen for at least 7 days. Population PK and PD models were used to estimate PK and PD parameters for 127 clinically evaluable patients. A 10,000-patient Monte Carlo simulation was performed to estimate the target time in which free drug concentrations exceeded the MIC of the infecting organism. The 2 PK-PD targets of microbiologic efficacy included ≥30\% for bacteriostasis and ≥50\% for bactericidal effects of ticarcillin-clavulanate at higher than FDA-approved doses.


RESULTS

A total of 127 patients (age, 0-19 years) met inclusion criteria. Serum concentration levels were modeled in this patient population using published PK parameters with intermittent ticarcillin peak concentrations reaching 288 (93.4) mg/L. The model predicted the PTA of the MICs for P. aeruginosa with a near-maximal bactericidal PK-PD MIC breakpoint of 16 μg/mL and a bacteriostasis PK-PD MIC breakpoint of 32 μg/mL.


CONCLUSIONS

The results of our simulation suggest that in this select pediatric population, higher than FDA-approved doses of ticarcillin-clavulanate were effective in achieving bactericidal effects among pseudomonal isolates with MICs {\textless}16 μg/mL. Bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects were not frequently achieved among P. aeruginosa isolates with MICs {\textgreater}32 μg/mL. Additional studies are warranted to determine the clinical effectiveness of this dosing regimen.},

Further, the levels of parasite burden and IL-4 were distinctly correlated in various clinical forms of CL. Other cytokines were at comparable levels in early/late lesions and in different clinical forms. Upregulation of IL-4 was correlated with a higher parasite burden in early lesions of CL, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of CL by inhibiting a protective immune response.},

	doi = {10.1128/AAC.01393-12},
	abstract = {Resistance to β-lactam antibiotics is a frequent problem in Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. This resistance is mainly due to the hyperproduction of chromosomally encoded β-lactamase and biofilm formation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of β-lactamase in the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ceftazidime and imipenem on P. aeruginosa biofilms. P. aeruginosa PAO1 and its corresponding β-lactamase-overproducing mutant, PAΔDDh2Dh3, were used in this study. Biofilms of these two strains in flow chambers, microtiter plates, and on alginate beads were treated with different concentrations of ceftazidime and imipenem. The kinetics of antibiotics on the biofilms was investigated in vitro by time-kill methods. Time-dependent killing of ceftazidime was observed in PAO1 biofilms, but concentration-dependent killing activity of ceftazidime was observed for β-lactamase-overproducing biofilms of P. aeruginosa in all three models. Ceftazidime showed time-dependent killing on planktonic PAO1 and PAΔDDh2Dh3. This difference is probably due to the special distribution and accumulation in the biofilm matrix of β-lactamase, which can hydrolyze the β-lactam antibiotics. The PK/PD indices of the AUC/MBIC and C(max)/MBIC (AUC is the area under concentration-time curve, MBIC is the minimal biofilm-inhibitory concentration, and C(max) is the maximum concentration of drug in serum) are probably the best parameters to describe the effect of ceftazidime in β-lactamase-overproducing P. aeruginosa biofilms. Meanwhile, imipenem showed time-dependent killing on both PAO1 and PAΔDDh2Dh3 biofilms. An inoculum effect of β-lactams was found for both planktonic and biofilm P. aeruginosa cells. The inoculum effect of ceftazidime for the β-lactamase-overproducing mutant PAΔDDh2Dh3 biofilms was more obvious than for PAO1 biofilms, with a requirement of higher antibiotic concentration and a longer period of treatment.},

Initially, NIRS was evaluated for spectrum acquisition of various drugs, selected in order to observe the diversity of physico-chemical characteristics found among commercial products. The parameters which could affect the spectra of a given drug (especially if presented in solid form) were investigated and the results showed that the first derivative can minimise spectral changes associated with tablet geometry, physical differences in their faces and position in relation to the probe beam. The power of NIRS in distinguishing among similar pharmaceuticals was demonstrated and a protocol is proposed to construct a multivariate model and to include it in a library allowing testing for drug authenticity. The methodology was evaluated with real samples of counterfeit drugs and was able to recognise all those presenting changes in composition as false. The results show unequivocally the potential of NIRS for rapid, on-site and non-destructive identification of counterfeit pharmaceuticals.},

However, some clinical studies have suggested that MLF shows significantly less efficiency against the cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania braziliensis. In this work, we have determined the cellular and molecular basis for the natural MLF resistance observed in L. braziliensis. Four independent L. braziliensis clinical isolates showed a marked decrease in MLF sensitivity that was due to their inability to internalize the drug. MLF internalization in the highly sensitive L. donovani species requires at least two proteins in the plasma membrane, LdMT, a P-type ATPase involved in phospholipid translocation, and its beta subunit, LdRos3. Strikingly, L. braziliensis parasites showed highly reduced levels of this MLF translocation machinery at the plasma membrane, mainly because of the low expression levels of the beta subunit, LbRos3. Overexpression of LbRos3 induces increased MLF sensitivity not only in L. braziliensis promastigotes but also in intracellular amastigotes. These results further highlight the importance of the MLF translocation machinery in determining MLF potency and point toward the development of protocols to routinely monitor MLF susceptibility in geographic areas where L. braziliensis might be prevalent.},

	abstract = {In the paediatric population, developmental changes can be predicted by age and are independent of size, which is predicted by bodyweight. Size is commonly standardised using either the per kilogram or the body surface area models. A great many physiological-, structural- and time-related variables scale predictably within and between species with weight exponents of 0.75, 1 and 0.25, respectively. Use of the per kilogram size model has led to the misconception that children have an enhanced capacity to metabolise drugs because of their relatively large liver size or increased hepatic blood flow. This is not necessarily the case. For example, the clearance of opioids often approaches adult rates within the first few months of life when an allometric 3/4 power model is used to scale for size. Age-related changes in physiological processes, such as respiration and cardiac output, disappear with appropriate size models. Size is an important, but little recognised, component in the speed of onset of drugs effects and uptake of inhalational anaesthetic agents. Size models cannot be reliably used to predict dose regimens for children from schedules established for adult patients. Dosage regimens are dependent on clearance and volume of distribution as well as pharmacodynamic factors, which change with age. The age-dependent pharmacodynamic changes described for some opioids in the very young have not yet been completely disentangled from age-related pharmacokinetic changes. When bodyweight is standardised and disentangled from age, developmental changes can be understood more clearly. The future investigation of drugs used in paediatric practice must also include an appropriate size model in order to differentiate age-related factors from size-related factors.},

	abstract = {Leishmania donovani promastigotes introduced into the bloodstream by sandfly vectors, are exposed to reactive oxygen species like H2O2 during phagocytosis by the host macrophages. H2O2 can induce promastigote death, but the mechanism of induction of this death is not known. Studies presented in this paper demonstrate that exposure to 4 mM H2O2 results in a pattern of promastigote death that shares many features with metazoan apoptosis. Motility and cell survival in these parasites show a gradual decline with increasing doses of H2O2. Features common to metazoan apoptosis, such as nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation with accompanying DNA ladder formation and loss of cell volume, are observed after exposure to 4 mM H2O2. Within 30 minutes of the exposure, there is a significant increase in the ability of the cell lysates to cleave the fluorogenic tetrapeptide acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin, which is a substrate for the CED-3/CPP32 group of proteases. Pretreatment of cells with a specific inhibitor of CED-3/CPP32 group of proteases, Z-DEVD-FMK, reduces the number of cells showing apoptosis-like features, prevents DNA breakage and inhibits cleavage of a PARP-like protein. Activation of the caspase-like proteases is followed at 2 hours by the cleavage of a poly(ADP)ribose-polymerase-like protein and a reduction in intracellular glutathione concentration. DNA breakdown as detected by TdT labelling of cells and agarose gel electrophoresis is visible at 6 hours. Taken together, the above data show for the first time that there is a distinct pathway for apoptosis-like death in L. donovani.},

During follow-up, a progressive decline in parasitemia was observed under therapy, and all patients became PCR negative after a median of 5 weeks (range, 6 to 21 weeks). However, in eight of nine patients monitored for a median period of 88 weeks (range, 33 to 110 weeks), visceral leishmaniasis relapsed, with positive results by PCR with peripheral blood reappearing 1 to 2 weeks before the clinical onset of disease. Eight Leishmania infantum and two Leishmania donovani infections were identified by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.

The standard 28 day miltefosine monotherapy regimen is well tolerated, except for mild gastrointestinal side effects, although its teratogenic potential severely hampers its general use in the clinic and roll-out in national elimination programmes. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine are mainly characterized by its long residence time in the body, resulting in extensive drug accumulation during treatment and long elimination half-lives. At the moment, different combination therapy strategies encompassing miltefosine are being tested in multiple controlled clinical trials in various geographical areas of endemicity, both in South Asia and East Africa. We here review the most salient pre-clinical and clinical pharmacological aspects of miltefosine, its mechanism of action against Leishmania parasites and other pathogens, and provide a systematic overview of the efficacy and safety data from all clinical trials of miltefosine, either alone or in combination, in the treatment of VL and CL.},

	volume = {17 Suppl 1},
	issn = {0312-5963},
	abstract = {Malnutrition is a complex condition in which many deficiencies occur simultaneously. Protein-energy malnutrition is a major public health and clinical problem in paediatric practice that accounts for high child mortality and morbidity. It includes many different clinical syndromes with protean manifestations. The malnourished often have several concomitant diseases; drugs are therefore as widely used as in the well-nourished. The pathophysiological profile in malnutrition can alter pharmacokinetic processes, drug responses and toxicity. This review summarizes the available knowledge on nutrient-drug interactions in malnourished children. Although there is much evidence in the literature that diet and nutritional status are 2 important environmental variables determining the pharmacotoxicological properties of chemicals, there are few data on humans. Recently, intense effort has been initially directed at studying drug kinetics in grade III malnutrition, namely kwashiorkor and marasmus. Studies on drugs and nutrients indicate delayed or decreased absorption, reduced protein binding of several drugs, fluctuations in volume of distribution, altered hepatic oxidative drug biotransformations and conjugations, reduced elimination of conjugates and reduced elimination of renally excreted drugs. The estimated steady-state levels of a few drugs suggest accumulation. Bioavailability problems with certain drugs are due to divergent effects of pharmacokinetic processes. Clinical risk of toxicity appears to be higher in malnourished children. Rehabilitation studies suggest that a number of these pharmacological abnormalities can be reversed. The majority of studies have concentrated on single-dose pharmacokinetics in severely malnourished children. A number of abnormalities seen in drug disposition during the acute phase of malnutrition need to be confirmed for other grades of malnutrition. For practical purposes, it is important to consider steady-state levels and data in mild and moderate forms of growth-retarded children; drug-induced nutritional deficiencies can occur more easily in these populations. Although some of the drugs described in this review have been in use for many years, knowledge on drug response and toxicity is still only approximate. There is at present enough evidence to support monitoring plasma drug concentrations in malnourished children, particularly for those drugs which have dose-dependent kinetics and narrow margins of safety. The metabolism and disposition of xenobiotics seem to vary widely in children with protein-energy malnutrition. Therapeutic inadequacies and toxicities need careful evaluation in malnourished children.},

A range of mass spectrometric techniques, i.e., accurate mass mass spectrometry, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), has been employed to determine the AI in a counterfeit Halfan suspension, an antimalarial drug. In particular, use of LockSpray accurate mass MS/MS allowed identification of parts of the molecule from fragments, hence limiting the number of possible elemental compositions for the nominal mass of 278 found for the AI in the counterfeit product. The analysis of the isotope pattern observed for the protonated molecule further reduced the number of possible elemental compositions. A literature search for readily commercially available compounds of molecular formula C(12)H(14)N(4)O(2)S suggested that the AI was either sulfamethazine or sulfisomidine. An LC/MS separation of those two compounds and reference MS/MS spectra obtained for sulfamethazine and sulfisomidine led to the conclusion that the AI in the counterfeit Halfan suspension is sulfamethazine, which is an antibacterial agent.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index that best correlates to nitrofurantoin's antibacterial effect, we studied nitrofurantoin activity against common causative pathogens in uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI).
METHODS: Five isolates [two Escherichia coli (one isolate producing the ESBL CTX-M-15), two Enterococcus faecium (including one that was vancomycin resistant) and one Staphylococcus saprophyticus] were used. The MICs of nitrofurantoin were determined by Etest. Time-kill curves with different concentrations of nitrofurantoin (based on multiples of isolate-specific MICs) were followed over 24 h. An in vitro kinetic model was used to simulate different time-concentration profiles, exposing E. coli to nitrofurantoin for varying proportions of the dosing interval. The outcome parameters reduction in cfu 0-24 h (Δcfu0-24) and the area under the bactericidal curve (AUBC), were correlated with time over MIC (T{\textgreater}MIC) and area under the antibiotic concentration curve divided by the MIC (AUC/MIC).
RESULTS: A bactericidal effect at varying static drug concentrations was achieved for all isolates. All isolates showed similar kill curve profiles. In the kinetic model, the effect of nitrofurantoin on E. coli displayed a 4 log reduction in cfu/mL within 6 h at 8 × MIC. The outcome parameters Δcfu0-24 and AUBC had a good correlation with T{\textgreater}MIC (R ≈ 0.83 and R ≈ 0.67, respectively), whereas log(AUC/MIC) was significantly poorer (R ≈ 0.39 and R ≈ 0.53, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Nitrofurantoin was highly effective against E. coli and S. saprophyticus isolates; the killing effect against E. faecium was not as rapid, but still significant. Against E. coli, nitrofurantoin was mainly associated with a concentration-dependent action; this was confirmed in the kinetic model, in which T{\textgreater}MIC displayed the best correlation.},

This propitiates the need for pharmacodynamic markers to monitor and compare therapies, specifically for visceral leishmaniasis in which the primary recrudescence of parasites is a particularly long-term event that remains difficult to predict. We performed a systematic review of studies evaluating biomarkers in human visceral, cutaneous and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis patients, which yielded a total of 170 studies in which 53 potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers were identified. In conclusion, the large majority of these biomarkers constituted universal indirect markers of activation and subsequent waning of cellular immunity, therefore lacking specificity. Macrophage-related markers demonstrate favourable sensitivity and time-to-normal, but more evidence is required to establish a link between these markers and clinical outcome. Most promising are the markers directly related to the parasite burden, but future effort should be focused on optimization of the molecular or antigenic target to increase sensitivity of these markers. In general, future research should focus on the longitudinal evaluation of the pharmacodynamic biomarkers during treatment with an emphasis on the correlation of studied biomarkers and clinical parameters.},

While such pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies are useful for the identification of optimal clinical dosing regimens, they are resource intensive and are not routinely performed. A mathematical model capable of simulating the PK/PD properties of drug therapy for experimental TB offers a way to mitigate some of the practical obstacles to determining the PK/PD index that best correlates with efficacy. Here, we present a preliminary physiologically based PK/PD model of rifampin therapy in a mouse TB infection model. The computational framework integrates whole-body rifampin PKs, cell population dynamics for the host immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, drug-bacteria interactions, and a Bayesian method for parameter estimation. As an initial application, we calibrated the model to a set of available rifampin PK/PD data and simulated a separate dose fractionation experiment for bacterial killing kinetics in the lungs of TB-infected mice. The simulation results qualitatively agreed with the experimentally observed PK/PD correlations, including the identification of area under the concentration-time curve as best correlating with efficacy. This single-drug framework is aimed toward extension to multiple anti-TB drugs in order to facilitate development of optimal combination regimens.},

Dendritic cells (DC) are critical for initiation of protective immunity against Leishmania through induction of Th1 immunity via interleukin 12 (IL-12). Here, we investigated the effects of miltefosine on DC in Leishmania major infections. When cocultured with miltefosine for 4 days, the majority of in vitro-infected DC were free of parasites. Miltefosine treatment did not influence DC maturation (upregulation of major histocompatibility complex II [MHC II] or costimulatory molecules, e.g., CD40, CD54, and CD86) or significantly alter cytokine release (IL-12, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha], or IL-10). Further, miltefosine DC treatment did not alter antigen presentation, since unrestricted antigen-specific proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was observed upon stimulation with miltefosine-treated, infected DC. In addition, miltefosine application in vivo did not lead to maturation/emigration of skin DC. DC NO- production, a mechanism used by phagocytes to rid themselves of intracellular parasites, was also unaltered upon miltefosine treatment. Our data confirm prior studies indicating that in contrast to, e.g., pentavalent antimonials, miltefosine functions independently of the immune system, mostly through direct toxicity against the Leishmania parasite.},

	abstract = {Throughout the world, pentavalent antimonial compounds (Sb(v)) have been the mainstay of antileishmanial therapy for more than 50 years. Sb(v) has been highly effective in the treatment of Indian visceral leishmaniasis (VL: kala-azar) at a low dose (10 mg/kg) for short durations (6-10 days). But in the early 1980s reports of its ineffectiveness emerged, and the dose of Sb(v) was eventually raised to 20 mg/kg for 30-40 days. This regimen cures most patients with VL except in India, where the proportion of patients unresponsive to Sb(v) has steadily increased. In hyperendemic districts of north Bihar, 50-65\% patients fail treatment with Sb(v). Important reasons are rampant use of subtherapeutic doses, incomplete duration of treatment and substandard drugs. In vitro experiments have established emergence of Sb(v) resistant strains of Leishmania donovani, as isolates from unresponsive patients require 3-5 times more Sb(v) to reach similarly effectiveness against the parasite as in Sb(v) responders. Anthroponotic transmission in India has been an important factor in rapid increase in the Sb(v) refractoriness. Pentamidine was the first drug to be used and cured 99\% of these refractory patients, but over time even with double the amount of initial doses, it cures only 69-78\% patients now and its use has largely been abandoned in India. Despite several disadvantages, amphotericin B is the only drug available for use in these areas and should be used as first-line drug instead of Sb(v). The new oral antileishmanial drug miltefosine is likely to be the first-line drug in future. Unfortunately, development of newer antileishmanial drugs is rare; two promising drugs, aminosidine and sitamaquine, may be developed for use in the treatment of VL. Lipid associated amphotericin B has an excellent safety and efficacy profile, but remains out of reach for most patients because of its high cost.},

	abstract = {Summary
Governed by parasite and host factors and immunoinflammatory responses, the clinical spectrum of leishmaniasis encompasses subclinical (inapparent), localised (skin lesions), and disseminated infection (cutaneous, mucosal, or visceral). Symptomatic disease is subacute or chronic and diverse in presentation and outcome. Clinical characteristics vary further by endemic region. Despite T-cell-dependent immune responses, which produce asymptomatic and self-healing infection, or appropriate treatment, intracellular infection is probably life-long since targeted cells (tissue macrophages) allow residual parasites to persist. There is an epidemic of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and Pakistan and of visceral infection in India and Sudan. Diagnosis relies on visualising parasites in tissue or serology; culture and detection of parasite DNA are useful in the laboratory. Pentavalent antimony is the conventional treatment; however, resistance of visceral infection in India has spawned new treatment approaches—amphotericin B and its lipid formulations, injectable paromomycin, and oral miltefosine. Despite tangible advances in diagnosis, treatment, and basic scientific research, leishmaniasis is embedded in poverty and neglected. Current obstacles to realistic prevention and proper management include inadequate vector (sandfly) control, no vaccine, and insufficient access to or impetus for developing affordable new drugs.},

But interpretation of a positive test must be made cautiously having correlation with clinical findings as because it becomes false positive in Kala-azar free person.

METHODS: Leishmania parasites causing CL can now be genotyped by polymerase chain reaction techniques for detecting Leishmania DNA. Therefore, treatment recommendations can now be species based rather than based on geographical exposure. To review the evidence on which the recommendations were based, "LeishMan" (Leishmaniasis Management), a group of experts from 13 institutions in eight European countries, performed a PubMed MEDLINE) literature search and considered unpublished evidence and the experts' own personal experiences. The Oxford evidence grading system was used to evaluate the information.

Obviously, these different scenarios will have different detrimental effects on a patient's health. Establishing the degree of risk to the patient through determination of the composition of counterfeit medicines found in the market place is thus of paramount importance. In this work, classical least squares was used for predicting the composition of counterfeit Heptodin tablets found in a market survey. Near infrared chemical imaging (NIR-CI) was used as a non-destructive measurement technique. No prior knowledge about the origin and composition of the tablets was available. Good API (i.e., lamivudine) predictions were obtained, especially for tablets containing a high API (close to the authentic) dose. Concentration maps of each pure material, i.e., the API (lamivudine) and the excipients microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycollate, rice starch and talc, were estimated. Below 1\% of the energy was not explained by the model (residuals percentage) for every pixel in all 12 counterfeit tablets. The similarities among tablets with respect to the total API percentage determined, as well as the corresponding concentration maps, support the classification of the tablets into the different groups obtained in previous work.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fexinidazole is a 5-nitroimidazole recently included in a clinical efficacy trial as an oral drug for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). Preclinical studies showed it acts as a pharmacologically active pro-drug with two key active metabolites: sulfoxide and sulfone (the most active metabolite). The present studies aimed to determine the best dose regimen for the treatment of stage 2 sleeping sickness patients, which could eventually also treat stage 1 patients.
METHODS: Fexinidazole was assessed in 154 healthy adult male subjects of sub-Saharan African origin. Three initial first-in-human studies and two additional studies assessed a single ascending dose and multiple ascending doses (both under fasted conditions), tablet versus suspension formulation and food effect (fasted vs. high-fat meal and field-adapted food), and multiple ascending doses with a loading dose regimen under fed conditions.
RESULTS: Fexinidazole was well-tolerated in a single dose from 100 to 3,600 mg, with quick absorption of the parent drug and rapid metabolism into sulfoxide [time to maximum concentration (t max) 2-5 h] and sulfone (t max 18-24 h). The tablet formulation was approximately 25 \% less bioavailable than the suspension, and food intake increased drug absorption and plasma concentrations of fexinidazole and its two metabolites by approximately 200 \%. Fourteen-day multiple ascending dosing administered up to 3,600 mg/day in fasted conditions showed that fexinidazole was generally well-tolerated (mild to moderate, spontaneously reversible drug-related adverse events). Following the high-fat food effect finding, another study was conducted to evaluate the impact of a low-fat regimen closer to that of the target population, showing that the type of meal does not influence fexinidazole absorption. The last study showed that a loading dose of 1,800 mg/day for 4 days followed by a 1,200 mg/day regimen for 6 days with a normal meal provided the desired exposure of fexinidazole and its metabolites, particularly sulfone, with good tolerability. Based on preclinical evidence from a chronic infection mouse model, systemic drug concentrations obtained are expected to be clinically effective in stage 2 HAT.
CONCLUSIONS: These studies show that fexinidazole can be safely assessed in patients as a potential oral cure for both stages of HAT.},

Phospholipase D activity did not seem to be affected by HePC. In addition, the enhancement of the lysophosphatidylcholine content could be ascribed to phospholipase A2 activation. Moreover, transient HePC treatment had no effect on the fatty acid alkyl chain length or the fatty acid unsaturation rate. Concerning sterols, we found a strong reduction of the C24 alkylated sterol content, and the enhancement of the cholesterol content could be the result of the HePC condensation effect with sterols.

We have evaluated the role of C-reactive protein (CRP) in 201 children with visceral leishmaniasis at different stages of the disease to work out the relationship, if any, between CRP levels and disease activity, including response to therapy. The subjects belonged to the 2-12 year age group in whom CRP estimation was done on admission, every 5th day during treatment, and repeated on follow-up at 2 and 6 months. The levels were compared with those of 50 randomly chosen age-matched healthy children who served as controls. The mean serum CRP value in the study group before the commencement of treatment was 62.96 +/- 1.03 mg/l, which was significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.001) in comparison to the control group. Commencement of treatment resulted in a simultaneous decline in serum CRP. Parasitic clearance from the spleen was faster in patients with an initial low serum CRP level ({\textless} 60 mg/l) in comparison to patients with high levels ({\textgreater} 60 mg/l). During treatment, mean serum CRP levels were significantly higher in late responders than in early responders (p {\textless} 0.001).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

AmBisome® is an efficacious, safe anti-leishmanial treatment. There is growing interest in its use, either as a single dose or in combination treatments. In East Africa, the minimum optimal single-dosage has not been identified.


METHODS/DESIGN

An open-label, 2-arm, non-inferiority, multi-centre randomised controlled trial is being conducted to determine the optimal single-dose treatment with AmBisome®.Patients in the single-dose arm will receive one infusion on day 1, at a dose depending on body weight. For the first group of patients entered to the trial, the dose will be 7.5 mg/kg, but if this dose is found to be ineffective then in subsequent patient series the dose will be escalated progressively to 10, 12.5 and 15 mg/kg. Patients in the reference arm will receive a multi-dose regimen of AmBisome® (3 mg/kg/day on days 1-5, 14 and 21: total dose 21 mg/kg). Patients will be hospitalised for approximately one month after the start of treatment and then followed up at three and six months. The primary endpoint is the status of patients six months after treatment. A secondary endpoint is assessment at day 30. Treatment success is determined as the absence of parasites on microscopy samples taken from bone marrow, lymph node or splenic aspirates. Interim analyses to assess the comparative efficacy of the single dose are planned after recruitment of 20 and 40 patients per arm. The final non-inferiority analysis will include 120 patients per arm, to determine if the single-dose efficacy 6 months after treatment is not more than 10\% inferior to the multi-dose.


DISCUSSION

An effective, safe single-dose treatment would reduce hospitalization and treatment costs. Results will inform the design of combination treatment studies.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti-leishmanial drug regimens that include a single dose AmBisome could be suitable for eastern African patients with symptomatic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) but the appropriate single dose is unknown.
METHODOLOGY: A multi-centre, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial with an adaptive design, was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of a single dose and multiple doses of AmBisome for the treatment of VL in eastern Africa. The primary efficacy endpoint was definitive cure (DC) at 6 months. Symptomatic patients with parasitologically-confirmed, non-severe VL, received a single dose of AmBisome 7.5 mg/kg body weight or multiple doses, 7 times 3 mg/kg on days 1-5, 14, and 21. If interim analyses, evaluated 30 days after the start of treatment following 40 or 80 patients, showed the single dose gave significantly poorer parasite clearance than multiple doses at the 5\% significance level, the single dose was increased by 2·5 mg/kg. In a sub-set of patients, parasite clearance was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT) PCR.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The trial was terminated after the third interim analysis because of low efficacy of both regimens. Based on the intention-to-treat population, DC was 85\% (95\%CI 73-93\%), 40\% (95\%CI 19-64\%), and 58\% (95\%CI 41-73\%) in patients treated with multiple doses (n = 63), and single doses of 7·5 (n = 21) or 10 mg/kg (n = 40), respectively. qRT-PCR suggested superior parasite clearance with multiple doses as early as day 3. Safety data accorded with the drug label.
CONCLUSIONS: The tested AmBisome regimens would not be suitable for VL treatment across eastern Africa. An optimal single dose regimen was not identified.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High frequency of relapse in miltefosine-treated visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients in India and Nepal followed up for twelve months.
OBJECTIVE: To identify epidemiological and clinical risk factors for relapse of VL in patients recently treated with standard dosing of miltefosine in India and Nepal.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study in three Primary Health Centers and one reference center in Muzaffarpur district, Bihar, India; and two zonal hospitals and a university hospital in South-east Nepal; records of all consenting patients diagnosed with VL and treated with miltefosine according to the current treatment guidelines of the Kala azar elimination program between 2009 and 2011.
RESULTS: We compared the clinical records of 78 cases of relapse with those of 775 patients who had no record of subsequent relapse. Relapse was 2 times more common amongst male patients (IRR 2.14, 95\% CI 1.27-3.61), and 2 to 3 times more frequent in the age groups below 15 compared to the over 25 year olds (age 10 to 14: IRR 2.53; 95\% CI 1.37-4.65 and Age 2 to 9: IRR 3.19; 95\% CI 1.77-5.77). History of earlier VL episodes, or specific clinical features at time of diagnosis such as duration of symptoms or spleen size were no predictors of relapse.
CONCLUSIONS: Young age and male gender were associated with increased risk of VL relapse after miltefosine, suggesting that the mechanism of relapse is mainly host-related i.e. immunological factors and/or drug exposure (pharmacokinetics). The observed decrease in efficacy of miltefosine may be explained by the inclusion of younger patients compared to the earlier clinical trials, rather than by a decreased susceptibility of the parasite to miltefosine. Our findings highlight the importance of proper clinical trials in children, including pharmacokinetics, to determine the safety, efficacy, drug exposure and therapeutic response of new drugs in this age group.},

	abstract = {Following resurgence in Bihar of epidemic kala-azar, outbreaks of the disease were identified simultaneously in two separate foci about 500 km apart in West Bengal in 1980. While the outbreak in one of these foci, in northern West Bengal, was the result of a direct extension of the Bihar epidemic, the source of parasite in the other (in the village of Bandipur in the south of West Bengal) remained unknown until a case of nodulo-ulcerative post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) was located in the village. The continued presence of this case in the village from a time long before the outbreak aroused strong suspicion about its causal role. Laboratory-bred female Phlebotomus argentipes sandflies were allowed to feed on four cases of PKDL, including the case from Bandipur, to determine the transmission potential of these cases. Of a total of 400 flies in the experiment, 104 (26\%) fed on the cases, and of these flies 44 died (31 within 48 hours of feeding). Of the surviving 60 flies, 32 developed promastigotes in the mid-gut. In view of the presence of the case of PKDL in the village prior to the outbreak and the availability of a susceptible human population and vectors, it is possible that the patient with PKDL was a source of Leishmania donovani parasites for the local focus. Furthermore, PKDL may act as a reservoir of parasites during inter-epidemic periods.},

METHODS: A multi-centre randomized-controlled trial (RCT) to compare efficacy and safety of PM (20 mg/kg/day for 21 days) and PM plus sodium stibogluconate (SSG) combination (PM, 15 mg/kg/day and SSG, 20 mg/kg/day for 17 days) with SSG (20 mg/kg/day for 30 days) for treatment of VL in East Africa. Patients aged 4-60 years with parasitologically confirmed VL were enrolled, excluding patients with contraindications. Primary and secondary efficacy outcomes were parasite clearance at 6-months follow-up and end of treatment, respectively. Safety was assessed mainly using adverse event (AE) data.
FINDINGS: The PM versus SSG comparison enrolled 205 patients per arm with primary efficacy data available for 198 and 200 patients respectively. The SSG \& PM versus SSG comparison enrolled 381 and 386 patients per arm respectively, with primary efficacy data available for 359 patients per arm. In Intention-to-Treat complete-case analyses, the efficacy of PM was significantly lower than SSG (84.3\% versus 94.1\%, difference = 9.7\%, 95\% confidence interval, CI: 3.6 to 15.7\%, p = 0.002). The efficacy of SSG \& PM was comparable to SSG (91.4\% versus 93.9\%, difference = 2.5\%, 95\% CI: -1.3 to 6.3\%, p = 0.198). End of treatment efficacy results were very similar. There were no apparent differences in the safety profile of the three treatment regimens.
CONCLUSION: The 17 day SSG \& PM combination treatment had a good safety profile and was similar in efficacy to the standard 30 day SSG treatment, suggesting suitability for VL treatment in East Africa.

We demonstrate that miltefosine is rapidly incorporated into yeast, where it penetrates the mitochondrial inner membrane, disrupting mitochondrial membrane potential and leading to an apoptosis-like cell death. COX9, which encodes subunit VIIa of the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) complex in the electron transport chain of the mitochondrial membrane, was identified as a potential target of miltefosine from a genomic library screen of the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When overexpressed in S. cerevisiae, COX9, but not COX7 or COX8, led to a miltefosine-resistant phenotype. The effect of miltefosine on COX activity was assessed in cells expressing different levels of COX9. Miltefosine inhibited COX activity in a dose-dependent manner in Cox9p-positive cells. This inhibition most likely contributed to the miltefosine-induced apoptosis-like cell death.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Antimonials are the mainstay of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) treatment in Africa. The increasing incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection requires alternative safe and effective drug regimens. Oral miltefosine has been proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of Indian VL but has not been studied in Africa or in persons with HIV and VL coinfection.


METHODS

We compared the efficacy of miltefosine and sodium stibogluconate (SSG) in the treatment of VL in persons in Ethiopia. A total of 580 men with parasitologically and/or serologically confirmed VL were randomized to receive either oral miltefosine (100 mg per day for 28 days) or intramuscular SSG (20 mg/kg per day for 30 days).


RESULTS

The initial cure rate was 88\% in both treatment groups. Mortality during treatment was 2\% in the miltefosine group, compared with 10\% in the SSG group. Initial treatment failure was 8\% in the miltefosine group, compared with 1\% in the SSG group. Among the 375 patients (65\%) who agreed to HIV testing, HIV seroprevalence was 29\%. Among patients not infected with HIV, initial cure, mortality, and initial treatment failure rates were not significantly different (94\% vs. 95\%, 1\% vs. 3\%, and 5\% vs. 1\% for the miltefosine and SSG groups, respectively). Initial treatment failure with miltefosine occurred in 18\% of HIV-coinfected patients, compared with treatment failure in 5\% of non-HIV-infected patients. At 6 months after treatment, 174 (60\%) of the 290 miltefosine recipients and 189 (65\%) of the 290 SSG recipients experienced cure; 30 (10\%) of 290 in the miltefosine group and 7 (2\%) of 290 in the SSG group experienced relapse, and the mortality rate was 6\% in the miltefosine group, compared with 12\% in the SSG group. HIV-infected patients had higher rates of relapse (16 [25\%] of 63 patients), compared with non-HIV-infected patients (5 [5\%] of 131).


CONCLUSIONS

Treatment with miltefosine is equally effective as standard SSG treatment in non-HIV-infected men with VL. Among HIV-coinfected patients, miltefosine is safer but less effective than SSG.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a sequel to visceral leishamaniasis (VL) in 5-15\% cases, constitutes a parasite reservoir important in disease transmission. The precise immunological cause of PKDL outcome remains obscure. However, overlapping counter regulatory responses with elevated IFN-γ and IL-10 are reported.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS

Present study deals with ex-vivo mRNA and protein analysis of natural regulatory T cells (nTreg) markers (Foxp3, CD25 and CTLA-4) and IL-10 levels in lesion tissues of PKDL patients at pre and post treatment stages. In addition, correlation of nTreg markers and IL-10 with parasite load in tissue lesions was investigated. mRNA levels of nTreg markers and IL-10 were found significantly elevated in pre-treatment PKDL cases compared to controls (Foxp3, P = 0.0009; CD25 \& CTLA-4, P{\textless}0.0001; IL-10, P{\textless}0.0001), and were restored after treatment. Analysis of nTreg cell markers and IL-10 in different clinical manifestations of disease revealed elevated levels in nodular lesions compared to macules/papules. Further, Foxp3, CD25 and IL-10 mRNA levels directly correlated with parasite load in lesions tissues.


CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE

Data demonstrated accumulation of nTreg cells in infected tissue and a correlation of both IL-10 and nTreg levels with parasite burden suggesting their role in disease severity in PKDL.},

We are unaware of a systematically designed dose fractionation study to compare the bactericidal activity of once-daily administration to that of traditional twice-daily administration. A dose fractionation study was performed with vancomycin in an in vitro hollow-fiber infection model against an MRSA USA300 strain (MIC of 0.75 μg/ml) using an inoculum of ∼10(6) CFU/ml. The three vancomycin regimens evaluated for 168 h were 2 g every 24 h (q24h) as a 1-h infusion, 1 g q12h as a 1-h infusion, and 2 g q24h as a continuous infusion. Free steady-state concentrations (assuming 45\% binding) for a total daily AUC/MIC ratio of ≥400 were simulated for all regimens. A validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was used to determine vancomycin concentrations. Although once-daily and twice-daily dosage regimens exhibited total trough concentrations of {\textless}15 μg/ml, all regimens achieved similar bactericidal activities between 24 and 168 h and suppressed the amplification of nonsusceptible subpopulations. No colonies were found on agar plates with 3× MIC for any of the treatment arms. Overall, the results suggest that once-daily vancomycin administration is feasible from a PK/PD perspective and merits further inquiry in the clinical arena.},

Serum nitrite level decreased significantly in patients as compared to the healthy individuals but significantly increased following 4 weeks of chemotherapy. Conversely, Increased ADA activity was observed in the beginning of treatment and decreased significantly with successive 4 weeks of chemotherapy. It seems a negative correlation between NO level and ADA activity. This result indicates parasite induced evasion of NO and activation of T lymphocytes during immunopathogenesis of VL.

One hundred sixteen children aged 2-12 years with parasitologically confirmed cutaneous leishmaniasis were randomized to directly observed treatment with meglumine antimoniate (20 mg Sb/kg/d for 20 days; intramuscular) (n = 58) or miltefosine (1.8-2.5 mg/kg/d for 28 days; by mouth) (n = 58). Primary outcome was treatment failure at or before week 26 after initiation of treatment. Miltefosine was noninferior if the proportion of treatment failures was ≤15\% higher than achieved with meglumine antimoniate (1-sided test, α = .05).


RESULTS

Ninety-five percent of children (111/116) completed follow-up evaluation. By intention-to-treat analysis, failure rate was 17.2\% (98\% confidence interval [CI], 5.7\%-28.7\%) for miltefosine and 31\% (98\% CI, 16.9\%-45.2\%) for meglumine antimoniate. The difference between treatment groups was 13.8\%, (98\% CI, -4.5\% to 32\%) (P = .04). Adverse events were mild for both treatments.


CONCLUSIONS

Miltefosine is noninferior to meglumine antimoniate for treatment of pediatric cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania (Viannia) species. Advantages of oral administration and low toxicity favor use of miltefosine in children.

The developed nanoemulsion MONe6 (size 168 ± 28 nm and zeta potential (ZP) 24.78 ± 0.45 mV, respectively) was effective for intracellular delivery and sustaining the release of MOX. MONe6 demonstrated improved plasma (AUC(MONe6/MOX) = 2.38-fold) and tissue pharmacokinetics of MOX (AUC(MONe6/MOX) = 2.63 and 1.47 times in lung and liver, respectively). Calculated PK/PD index correlated well with a reduction in bacterial burden in plasma as well as tissues. Enhanced survival on treatment with MONe6 (65.44\%) and as compared to the control group (8.22\%) was a result of reduction in lipid peroxidation, neutrophil migration, and cytokine levels (TNF-α and IL6) as compared to untreated groups in the rat model of E. coli-induced sepsis. Parenteral nanoemulsions of MOX hold a promising advantage in the therapy of E. coli-induced complicated intra-abdominal infections and is helpful in the prevention of further complications like septic shock and death.},

The analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between the MST size and the frequency of ex vivo recent activated CD4(+) T cells. In contrast, higher frequencies of recent activated CD8(+) T cells were correlated with a smaller MST size. Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between the lesion total area and the frequency of activated CD69(+) (ex vivo) and CD40L(+) (cultured with Leishmania soluble antigen (SLA)) T lymphocytes. Finally, larger lesions were also correlated with a higher frequency of SLA specific inflammatory cytokine (IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha) producing lymphocytes.

This longitudinal study was undertaken to determine the incidence of VL in a Community Development Block area of the state of Bihar. Survey results were compared with official reports of the disease to assess the extent of underreporting by the Government health system. METHODS: Three health subcentre areas in Kanti Block, consisting of 14 villages with a total population of 26 444, were selected. Active surveillance was performed every month from January 2001 to December 2003 by house to house survey to detect cases of fever for more than 15 days. Patients clinically suspected of suffering from VL were subjected to parasitological examination for confirmation. Analysis of records of the reporting agencies in the district was undertaken to compare and assess the extent of underreporting. RESULTS: A total of 202 cases of VL were identified in 3 years giving an average annual incidence rate of 2.49/1000 population (95\% CI = 2.15-2.83). As identification data of patients was not available with the official reporting agencies for 2001 and 2002, extent of underreporting could be assessed for 2003 only. In the study population, 65 cases of VL were detected during 2003 providing an annual incidence rate of 2.36/1000 population. Only eight (12.30\%) cases were reported officially, resulting in underreporting by a factor of 8.13. In 2003, the official incidence rate of VL for Kanti Block was 0.31/1000 against the actual rate of 2.36/1000. As the constraints for official reporting at the block and the district levels are similar, the underreporting at district level was also assumed to be similar. This finding has significance in the preparation for elimination programme.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

There is no effective oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), a disseminated intracellular protozoal infection that occurs worldwide. Miltefosine, an alkyl phospholipid developed as an oral antineoplastic agent, is active against visceral infection in animal models. We tested safety, tolerance, and efficacy of miltefosine in kala-azar.


METHODS

Oral doses of miltefosine were given to six groups of five Indian men for 28 days: 50 mg every second day (group 1), 100 mg every second day (group 2), 100 mg/day (group 3), 150 mg/day (group 4), 200 mg/day (group 5), and 250 mg/day (group 6). Assessment for apparent cure--taken as an afebrile state with decreased spleen size and a splenic-aspirate parasite-density score of 0--was done on days 14 and 28. Definitive cure at 8 months required a parasite-free bone-marrow aspirate and no clinical evidence of relapse.


FINDINGS

21 of 30 patients were apparently cured on day 14. Transient episodes of vomiting and diarrhoea, were common during weeks 1-2 and were seen in 22 patients. Four other patients in groups 5 and 6 had miltefosine withdrawn after 7-10 days because of vomiting. One patient in group 6 developed renal insufficiency and severe diarrhoea and died on day 21. On day 28, all 29 remaining patients were apparently cured. By 8 months, seven of ten patients in groups 1 and 2 had relapsed; however, 18 of 19 patients treated daily (groups 3-6) appeared to be cured. Among the 21 definitive cures were the four patients treated for 10 days or less and 12 for whom previous therapy with pentavalent antimony had failed.


INTERPRETATION

Treatment with miltefosine at 100-150 mg/day for 4 weeks has promise as an effective oral treatment of visceral leishmaniasis including antimony-resistant infection.},

	abstract = {We have developed a simple, rapid, and reliable protocol for the small-scale purification of DNA and RNA from, e.g., human serum and urine. The method is based on the lysing and nuclease-inactivating properties of the chaotropic agent guanidinium thiocyanate together with the nucleic acid-binding properties of silica particles or diatoms in the presence of this agent. By using size-fractionated silica particles, nucleic acids (covalently closed circular, relaxed circular, and linear double-stranded DNA; single-stranded DNA; and rRNA) could be purified from 12 different specimens in less than 1 h and were recovered in the initial reaction vessel. Purified DNA (although significantly sheared) was a good substrate for restriction endonucleases and DNA ligase and was recovered with high yields (usually over 50\%) from the picogram to the microgram level. Copurified rRNA was recovered almost undegraded. Substituting size-fractionated silica particles for diatoms (the fossilized cell walls of unicellular algae) allowed for the purification of microgram amounts of genomic DNA, plasmid DNA, and rRNA from cell-rich sources, as exemplified for pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. In this paper, we show representative experiments illustrating some characteristics of the procedure which may have wide application in clinical microbiology.},

In contrast to most antitumor substances, the alkylphosphocholines do not attack the cell nucleus, but the cell membrane. This report presents a systematic study which, for the first time, provides a correlation between their chemical structure, antitumor efficacy and selectivity. Through an understanding of the metabolism of tumor growth inhibiting (ether)-lysolecithins, the minimal structural requirements for the antineoplastic efficacy of these substances have been obtained. This knowledge was used to identify molecular structures which are more effective and less toxic for the organism. The active principle derived from a study of (ether)-lysolecithins active as antitumor agents represents a new class of compounds: the alkylphosphocholines. As reported here, hexadecylphosphocholine is the most promising candidate of this group of compounds. It has an extremely selective action against chemically induced, autochthonous rat mammary carcinomas. No loss of activity was observed when comparing oral and intravenous administration. Particularly striking (and favorable for long-term therapy) is the fact that immunosuppression and hematotoxicity were not found at drug concentrations which lead to complete tumor remissions. Results obtained from animal experiments have been confirmed by preliminary clinical investigations.},

All animals became infected at both doses, although significant differences were observed between parasite burdens in liver and spleen. The mean number of parasites in animals infected with 10(7) promastigotes increased by 9.5 times in liver and by 43.1 times in spleen compared with those infected with 10(5) promastigotes.

We address the role of the differential decline of IL-10 and TGF-beta in response to sodium antimony gluconate (SAG) and amphotericin B (AmB), the therapeutic success of SAG and AmB in Indian VL, and the significance of IL-10 and TGF-beta in the development and progression of post-kazla-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). In the active disease, PBMC from VL patients showed suppressed Ag-specific lymphoproliferation, IFN-gamma and IL-12 production, and elevation of IL-10 and TGF-beta. Cure corresponded with an elevation in IFN-gamma and IL-12 production and down-regulation of IL-10 and TGF-beta. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were involved in IFN-gamma and IL-10 production. Interestingly, the retention and maintenance of residual IL-10 and TGF-beta in some SAG-treated individuals and the elevation of IL-10 and TGF-beta in PKDL, a sequel to kala-azar, probably reflects the role of these cytokines in reactivation of the disease in the form of PKDL. Contrastingly, AmB treatment of VL resulted in negligible TGF-beta levels and absolute elimination of IL-10, reflecting the better therapeutic activity of AmB and its probable role in the recent decline in PKDL occurrences in India. Moreover, elucidation of immune responses in Indian PKDL patients revealed a spectral pattern of disease progression where disease severity could be correlated inversely with lymphoproliferation and directly with TGF-beta, IL-10, and Ab production. In addition, the enhancement of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells in active VL, their decline at cure, and reactivation in PKDL suggest their probable immunosuppressive role in these disease forms.},

Pentavalent antimonial drugs are the most prescribed treatment for American cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Other drugs have been used with varying success.


OBJECTIVES

To assess the effects of therapeutic interventions for American cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis.


SEARCH STRATEGY

We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (January 2009), the Register of Controlled Clinical Trials in The Cochrane Library (Issue 1,2009), MEDLINE (2003 to January 2009), EMBASE (2005 to January 2009), LILACS (from inception to January 2009), CINAHL (1982-May 2007) and other databases.


SELECTION CRITERIA

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing treatments for American cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.


MAIN RESULTS

We included 38 trials involving 2728 participants. Results are based on individual studies or limited pooled analyses. There was good evidence in:Leishmania braziliensis and L. panamensis infections:Intramuscular (IM) meglumine antimoniate (MA) was better than oral allopurinol for 28 days (1RCT n=127, RR 0.39; 95\% CI 0.26, 0.58). Intravenous (IV)MA for 20-days was better than 3-day and 7-day IVMA plus 15\% paromomycin plus 12\% methylbenzethonium chloride (PR-MBCL) or 7-day IVMA (1RCT n= 150, RR 0.24; 95\% CI 0.11, 0.50; RR 0.69; 95\% CI 0.53, 0.90; RR 0.64; 95\% CI 0.44, 0.92 respectively).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Some 50\% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) worldwide live in the Indian state of Bihar. Liposomal amphotericin B is an effective treatment when administered in short courses. We wanted to determine whether the efficacy of a single infusion of liposomal amphotericin B was inferior to conventional parenteral therapy, consisting of 15 alternate-day infusions of amphotericin B deoxycholate.


METHODS

In this open-label study, we randomly assigned 412 patients in a 3:1 ratio to receive either liposomal amphotericin B (liposomal-therapy group) or amphotericin B deoxycholate (conventional-therapy group). Liposomal amphotericin B (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight) was given once, and patients were discharged home 24 hours later. Amphotericin B deoxycholate, which was administered in 15 infusions of 1 mg per kilogram, was given every other day during a 29-day hospitalization. We determined the cure rate 6 months after treatment.


RESULTS

A total of 410 patients--304 of 304 patients (100\%) in the liposomal-therapy group and 106 of 108 patients (98\%) in the conventional-therapy group--had apparent cure responses at day 30. Cure rates at 6 months were similar in the two groups: 95.7\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 93.4 to 97.9) in the liposomal-therapy group and 96.3\% (95\% CI, 92.6 to 99.9) in the conventional-therapy group. Adverse events in the liposomal-therapy group were infusion-related fever or rigors (in 40\%) and increased anemia or thrombocytopenia (in 2\%); such events in the conventional-therapy group were fever or rigors (in 64\%), increased anemia (in 19\%), and hypokalemia (in 2\%). Nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity developed in no more than 1\% of patients in each group.


CONCLUSIONS

A single infusion of liposomal amphotericin B was not inferior to and was less expensive than conventional therapy with amphotericin B deoxycholate. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00628719.)},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a major health problem in developing countries. The untreated disease is fatal, available treatment is expensive and often toxic, and drug resistance is increasing. Improved treatment options are needed. Paromomycin was shown to be an efficacious first-line treatment with low toxicity in India.


METHODS

This was a 3-arm multicentre, open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial to compare three treatment regimens for VL in East Africa: paromomycin sulphate (PM) at 15 mg/kg/day for 21 days versus sodium stibogluconate (SSG) at 20 mg/kg/day for 30 days; and the combination of both dose regimens for 17 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was cure based on parasite-free tissue aspirates taken 6 months after treatment.


FINDINGS

Overall, 135 patients per arm were enrolled at five centres in Sudan (2 sites), Kenya (1) and Ethiopia (2), when the PM arm had to be discontinued due to poor efficacy. The trial has continued with the higher dose of PM as well as the combination of PM and SSG arms. These results will be reported later. Baseline patient characteristics were similar among treatment arms. The overall cure with PM was significantly inferior to that with SSG (63.8\% versus 92.2\%; difference 28.5\%, 95\%CI 18.8\% to 38.8\%, p{\textless}0.001). The efficacy of PM varied among centres and was significantly lower in Sudan (14.3\% and 46.7\%) than in Kenya (80.0\%) and Ethiopia (75.0\% and 96.6\%). No major safety issues with PM were identified.


CONCLUSION

The efficacy of PM at 15 mg/kg/day for 21 days was inadequate, particularly in Sudan. The efficacy of higher doses and the combination treatment warrant further studies.},

The diversity of clinical study designs and analytical methods undermines the current ability to achieve this. The proposed World Antimalarial Resistance Network (WARN) aims to establish a comprehensive clinical database from which standardised estimates of antimalarial efficacy can be derived and monitored over time from diverse geographical and endemic regions. The emphasis of this initiative is on five key variables which define the therapeutic response. Ensuring that these data are collected at the individual patient level in a consistent format will facilitate better data management and analytical practices, and ensure that clinical data can be readily collated and made amenable for pooled analyses. Such an approach, if widely adopted will permit accurate and timely recognition of trends in drug efficacy. This will guide not only appropriate interventions to deal with established multidrug resistant strains of malaria, but also facilitate prompt action when new strains of drug resistant plasmodia first emerge. A comprehensive global database incorporating the key determinants of the clinical response with in vitro, molecular and pharmacokinetic parameters will bring together relevant data on host, drug and parasite factors that are fundamental contributors to treatment efficacy. This resource will help guide rational drug policies that optimize antimalarial drug use, in the hope that the emergence and spread of resistance to new drugs can be, if not prevented, at least delayed.},

However, logically it is difficult to perceive that the exponents of allometry for a given parameter will revolve around a fixed number. Over the last 80 years, theoretical biologists and physiologists are entangled in an argument whether the exponent of basal metabolic rate against body weight is 0.67 or 0.75. There are evidence for and against these two exponents. However, in-depth investigative works suggest that there is not really any universal exponent for any allometrically related parameter and the exponent of allometry depends on several factors. The main focus of this report is to show the readers that there is enough evidence from experimental data that negate the notion of fixed exponents in biology, physiology, and pharmacokinetics. In short, the notion of a fixed exponent is theoretical and there is no evidence that the exponent of a physiological or pharmacokinetic parameter revolves around a fixed number.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Marbofloxacin is a third-generation fluoroquinolone developed solely for veterinary medicine with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against some Gram-positive and most Gram-negative bacteria, including the bovine respiratory tract pathogen, Pasteurella multocida. The objective of our study was to elucidate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of marbofloxacin in a Pasteurella multocida infected murine lung model, and to estimate the magnitudes of pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics parameters associated with various effects.
RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic studies revealed marbofloxacin kinetics in infected mice were linear over a dose ranging from 1.25 to 10 mg/kg of body weight. The protein binding in the plasma of neutropenic infected mice was 29.77 \%. The magnitudes of the ratio of the free-drug area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h to MIC (fAUC0-24h/MIC) associated with static effect, a 2 log10 reduction and a 3 log10 reduction of bacterial counts were 40.84, 139.34, and 278.08 h, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the dose range study, marbofloxacin exhibited concentration-dependent killing and the fAUC/MIC was the PK/PD index that correlated best with efficacy (R(2) = 83 \%). On the basis of a bactericidal effect goal of fAUC0-24h/MIC of 278.08 h, if marbofloxacin is used for the treatment of P. multocida serious lung infection with an MIC90 of 0.12 μg/ml, the current dose (2 mg/kg) would fail to achieve a bactericidal effect. It would benefit from higher doses (4 {\textasciitilde} 6 mg/kg) than those commonly used in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {A real-time PCR was developed to quantify Leishmania infantum kinetoplast DNA and optimized to reach a sensitivity of 0.0125 parasites/ml of blood. In order to analyze the incidence of heterogeneity and number of minicircles, we performed comparative PCR by using the Leishmania DNA polymerase gene as a reporter. Assays performed in both promastigote and amastigote stages showed variations among different L. infantum and Leishmania donovani strains and the stability of the minicircle numbers for a particular strain. Analysis of blood samples from a patient who presented with Mediterranean visceral leishmaniasis confirmed the reliability of such an assay for Leishmania quantification in biological samples and allowed an estimation of positivity thresholds of classical tests used for direct diagnosis of the disease; positivity thresholds were in the range of 18 to 42, 0.7 to 42, and 0.12 to 22.5 parasites/ml for microscopic examination, culture, and conventional PCR, respectively. At the time of diagnosis, parasitemia could vary by a wide range (32 to 188,700 parasites/ml, with a median of 837 parasites/ml), while in bone marrow, parasite load was more than 100 parasites per 10(6) nucleated human cells. After successful therapy, parasitemia levels remain lower than 1 parasite/ml. In the immunocompromised host, relapses correlate with an increase in the level of parasitemia, sometimes scanty, justifying the need for assays with high sensitivity. Such sensitivity allows the detection of Leishmania DNA in the blood of 21\% of patients with no history of leishmaniasis living in the Marseilles area, where leishmaniasis is endemic. This technique may be useful for epidemiologic and diagnostic purposes, especially for the quantification of parasitemia at low levels during posttherapy follow-up.},

Methods The experiments were carried out using BALB/c mice and hamsters, infected with Leishmania donovani. CpG ODN was administered at various doses by the intraperitoneal (ip) route. The dose of CpG ODN (1 nM/single dose) showing best antileishmanial activity was given as free and liposomal forms with a subcurative dose of miltefosine, namely 2.5 and 5 mg/kg × 5 days in mice and hamsters, respectively.
Results Among the various groups of mice, co-administered liposomal CpG ODN and miltefosine showed the best inhibitory effect (85\% inhibition) compared with free CpG ODN and miltefosine, and miltefosine, free CpG ODN and liposomal CpG ODN separately. Production of Th1 cytokines, nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and H2O2 was enhanced. A remarkable increase in the phagocytosis index was also observed, indicating overall immunological support to antileishmanial activity of miltefosine by CpG ODN. Similar responses were observed in hamsters.
Conclusions Promising antileishmanial efficacy was observed in animals treated with liposomal CpG ODN and miltefosine, strongly supported by enhancement of Th1 cytokines as well as NO, ROS and H2O2 levels. The correlation of experimental findings in both the models (mouse and hamster) strengthens the potential of CpG ODN as an immunomodulator in combination with miltefosine against VL.},

However, the use and application of molecular assays are increasing, but comparative studies on the performance of these different assays are lacking. The aim of this study was to compare three molecular assays for detection and quantification of Leishmania parasites in serial dilutions of parasites and in skin biopsies collected from cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) patients in Manaus, Brazil. A serial dilution of promastigotes spiked in blood was tested in triplicate in three different runs by quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA), quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). In addition, the costs, durations, and numbers of handling steps were compared, and 84 skin biopsies from patients with suspected CL were tested. Both QT-NASBA and qRT-PCR had a detection limit of 100 parasites/ml of blood, while qPCR detected 1,000 parasites/ml. QT-NASBA had the lowest range of intra-assay variation (coefficients of variation [CV], 0.5\% to 3.3\%), while qPCR had the lowest range of interassay variation (CV, 0.4\% to 5.3\%). Furthermore, qRT-PCR had higher r2 values and amplification efficiencies than qPCR, and qPCR and qRT-PCR had faster procedures than QT-NASBA. All assays performed equally well with patient samples, with significant correlations between parasite counts. Overall, qRT-PCR is preferred over QT-NASBA and qPCR as the most optimal diagnostic assay for quantification of Leishmania parasites, since it was highly sensitive and reproducible and the procedure was relatively fast.},

Acquired resistance has been studied in the laboratory for several decades but it is only recently that clinical resistance in L. donovani field isolates has been demonstrated. The monitoring of resistance is problematic due to a reliance on the amastigote-macrophage culture assay to adequately correlate clinical and in vitro resistance and a lack of knowledge about the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of resistance to antileishmanial drugs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Definite diagnosis of Leishmania infections is based on demonstration of the parasite by microscopic analysis of tissue biopsy specimens or aspirate samples. However, microscopy generally shows low sensitivity and requires invasive sampling.


METHODS

We describe here the development of a simple and rapid test for the detection of polymerase chain reaction-amplified Leishmania DNA. A phase 1 evaluation of the text was conducted in clinical samples from 60 nonendemic and 45 endemic control subjects and from 44 patients with confirmed cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), 12 with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL), and 43 with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) from Peru, Kenya, and Sudan.


RESULTS

The lower detection limits of the assay are 10 fg of Leishmania DNA and 1 parasite in 180 microL of blood. The specificity was 98.3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 91.1\%-99.7\%) and 95.6\% (95\% CI, 85.2\%-98.8\%) for nonendemic and endemic control samples, respectively, and the sensitivity was 93.2\% (95\% CI, 81.8\%-97.7\%), 91.7\% (95\% CI, 64.6\%-98.5\%), and 86\% (95\% CI, 72.7\%-93.4\%) for lesions from patients with CL or MCL and blood from patients with VL, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS

The Leishmania OligoC-TesT showed high specificity and sensitivity in clinical samples and was able to detect the parasite in samples obtained by less invasive means, such as blood, lymph, and lesion scrapings. The assay is a promising new tool for simplified and standardized molecular detection of Leishmania parasites.},

Current and future drug options should therefore be better protected, requiring a clear understanding of the factors that contribute to the natural history of drug resistance. Although many of these factors are relatively well understood for most bacteria, this proves to be more complex for vectorborne parasites. In this review, we discuss considering three key models (Plasmodium, Leishmania and Schistosoma) how drug resistance can emerge, spread and persist. We demonstrate a multiplicity of scenarios, clearly resulting from the biological diversity of the different organisms, but also from the different modes of action of the drugs used, the specific within- and between-host ecology of the parasites, and environmental factors that may have direct or indirect effects. We conclude that integrated control of drug-resistant vectorborne parasites is not dependent upon chemotherapy only, but also requires a better insight into the ecology of these parasites and how their transmission can be impaired.},

This has spurred the need for pharmacodynamic markers to monitor and compare therapies specifically for visceral leishmaniasis, in which the primary recrudescence of parasites is a particularly long-term event that remains difficult to predict. We performed a systematic review of studies evaluating biomarkers in human patients with visceral, cutaneous, and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, which yielded a total of 170 studies in which 53 potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers were identified. In conclusion, the large majority of these biomarkers constituted universal indirect markers of activation and subsequent waning of cellular immunity and therefore lacked specificity. Macrophage-related markers demonstrate favorable sensitivity and times to normalcy, but more evidence is required to establish a link between these markers and clinical outcome. Most promising are the markers directly related to the parasite burden, but future effort should be focused on optimization of molecular or antigenic targets to increase the sensitivity of these markers. In general, future research should focus on the longitudinal evaluation of the pharmacodynamic biomarkers during treatment, with an emphasis on the correlation of studied biomarkers and clinical parameters.},

	abstract = {As part of a large-scale sero-epidemiological survey on visceral leishmaniasis (VL) carried out in Mymensingh district of Bangladesh, applicability of DAT was assessed at the level of a rural health setting in Trishal (upazila) subdistrict. Despite the relatively less optimal conditions encountered, 5854 inhabitants from 7 villages appendant to Trishal were assessed for VL. The demographic distribution for sero-positivity obtained at the rural setting was comparable to that found by DAT as executed at the central laboratory (IEDC\&R, Dhaka) on 9619 inhabitants from the same upazila. The overall sero-prevalence rate was 4.4\% compared to 3.7\% obtained in the population assessed at the central laboratory. In either study, similar VL prevalence rates of 2.1\% were obtained in the male populations. Irrespective of sex, younger population ({\textless} 20 years) in both studies appeared to have higher VL incidence rate (2.3\% and 2.6\%) than others of 21- {\textgreater} or = 90 years (1.4\% and 1.8\%). Local production of DAT antigen employing an authochtonus L. donovani isolate was attempted at the central laboratory (IEDC\&R) in Dhaka. By comparison with the reference antigen, titres obtained in all 33 VL sera tested were equally higher (1:6400- {\textgreater} or =: 51200) than in 35 out of 38 negative controls ({\textless} or = 1:400-1:1600). A comparable level of reactivity was also obtained in 53 VL and 52 negative control sera using a well characterized L. donovani strain (MHOM/IN/80/D88) from India. However, unlike the reference strain, titres obtained in 7 endemic controls were significantly higher with the authochtonous and homologous antigen (1:3200 - 1:6400) than with the reference (1:100 - 1:1600). The results signify the advantage of employing indigenous L. donovani isolates to further improve DAT sensitivity for detection of early and sub-clinical VL.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: AmBisome® is an efficacious, safe anti-leishmanial treatment. There is growing interest in its use, either as a single dose or in combination treatments. In East Africa, the minimum optimal single-dosage has not been identified.
METHODS/DESIGN: An open-label, 2-arm, non-inferiority, multi-centre randomised controlled trial is being conducted to determine the optimal single-dose treatment with AmBisome®.Patients in the single-dose arm will receive one infusion on day 1, at a dose depending on body weight. For the first group of patients entered to the trial, the dose will be 7.5 mg/kg, but if this dose is found to be ineffective then in subsequent patient series the dose will be escalated progressively to 10, 12.5 and 15 mg/kg. Patients in the reference arm will receive a multi-dose regimen of AmBisome® (3 mg/kg/day on days 1-5, 14 and 21: total dose 21 mg/kg). Patients will be hospitalised for approximately one month after the start of treatment and then followed up at three and six months. The primary endpoint is the status of patients six months after treatment. A secondary endpoint is assessment at day 30. Treatment success is determined as the absence of parasites on microscopy samples taken from bone marrow, lymph node or splenic aspirates. Interim analyses to assess the comparative efficacy of the single dose are planned after recruitment of 20 and 40 patients per arm. The final non-inferiority analysis will include 120 patients per arm, to determine if the single-dose efficacy 6 months after treatment is not more than 10\% inferior to the multi-dose.
DISCUSSION: An effective, safe single-dose treatment would reduce hospitalization and treatment costs. Results will inform the design of combination treatment studies.

Median daily fAUC/MIC values required for stasis or a 1-log reduction in bacterial burden were 8.1 and 14.4 for eleven S. pneumoniae isolates (R(2), 0.62) and 7.2 and 13.0 for five H. influenzae isolates (R(2), 0.93).

We provide an overview of the various guidelines concerning HAT and leishmaniasis over the past decades and show the confusion in the calculation of the dosage of pentamidine in these guidelines and the subsequent published reports on clinical trials and reviews. At present, only pentamidine isethionate is available, but the advised dosage for HAT and leishmaniasis is (historically) based on the amount of pentamidine base. In the treatment of leishmaniasis this is probably resulting in a subtherapeutic treatment. There is thus a need for a new, more transparent and concise guideline concerning the dosage of pentamidine, at least in the treatment of HAT and leishmaniasis.},

We hypothesized that the current linear dosage (in milligrams per kilogram of body weight) is too low for children and that a new dosing algorithm based on an appropriate body size model would result in an optimal exposure. A population PK analysis was performed on three historic pooled data sets, including Indian children, Indian adults, and European adults. Linear and allometric scaling of PK parameters by either body weight or fat-free mass (FFM) was evaluated for body size models. Based on the developed PK model, a dosing algorithm for miltefosine in children and adults was proposed and evaluated in silico. The population PK model employing allometric scaling fitted best to the pooled miltefosine data. Allometric scaling by FFM reduced between-subject variability, e.g., for drug clearance, from 49.6\% to 32.1\%. A new allometric miltefosine dosing algorithm was proposed. Exposure to miltefosine was lower in children than adults receiving 2.5 mg/kg/day: a C(max) of 18.8 μg/ml was reached by 90\% of adults and 66.7\% of children. The allometric daily dose resulted in similar levels of exposure to miltefosine for adults and children. The use of a new allometric dosing algorithm for miltefosine in VL patients results in optimal exposure to miltefosine in both adults and children and might improve clinical outcome in children.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Current diagnostic methods for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) have low sensitivity or are not useful for treatment follow-up. We previously described the quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA) method as a sensitive and specific assay for detection and quantification of Leishmania parasites in skin biopsies. This assay could be a valuable instrument for monitoring response to treatment of CL and identifying treatment failures at an early stage.


AIM

QT-NASBA results of skin biopsies at the end and 6 weeks after treatment from patients with proven CL on various treatment regimens were compared with clinical outcome.


METHODS

The QT-NASBA assay measured the parasite load in skin biopsies before, at the end and 6 weeks after treatment. The results were compared with treatment outcome (clinical cure, delayed healing response or treatment failure) up to 6 months after treatment.


RESULTS

In total, 137 skin biopsies were obtained from 53 patients. A positive QT-NASBA result 6 weeks after treatment was significantly associated with treatment failure/delayed healing up to 6 months (P {\textless} 0.001). The positive predictive value (PPV) was 100\% and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 92\% (95\% CI 82-100\%). QT-NASBA results at the end of treatment and clinical outcome showed a less significant association (P {\textless} 0.05), with a PPV of 46\% (95\% CI 16-75\% and an NPV of 89\% (95\% CI 79-99\%).


CONCLUSIONS

The QT-NASBA assay is a useful instrument to monitor parasite load in skin biopsies of patients with CL 6 weeks after treatment and can help to predict clinical outcome.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

In areas endemic for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a large number of infected individuals mount a protective cellular immune response and remain asymptomatic carriers. We propose an interferon-gamma release assay (IFN-γRA) as a novel marker for latent L. donovani infection.


METHODS AND FINDINGS

We modified a commercial kit (QuantiFERON) evaluating five different leishmania-specific antigens; H2B, H2B-PSA2, H2B-Lepp12, crude soluble antigen (CSA) and soluble leishmania antigen (SLA) from L. donovani with the aim to detect the cell-mediated immune response in VL. We evaluated the assay on venous blood samples of active VL patients (n = 13), cured VL patients (n = 15), non-endemic healthy controls (n = 11) and healthy endemic controls (n = 19). The assay based on SLA had a sensitivity of 80\% (95\% CI = 54.81-92.95) and specificity of 100\% (95\% CI = 74.12-100).


CONCLUSION

Our findings suggest that a whole-blood SLA-based QuantiFERON assay can be used to measure the cell-mediated immune response in L. donovani infection. The positive IFN-γ response to stimulation with leishmania antigen in patients with active VL was contradictory to the conventional finding of a non-proliferative antigen-specific response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and needs further research.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
In 1975–99, only 1·1\% of new therapeutic products had been developed for neglected diseases. Since then, several public and private initiatives have attempted to mitigate this imbalance. We analysed the research and development pipeline of drugs and vaccines for neglected diseases from 2000 to 2011.
Methods
We searched databases of drug regulatory authorities, WHO, and clinical trial registries for entries made between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2011. We defined neglected diseases as malaria, tuberculosis, diarrhoeal diseases, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs; WHO definition), and other diseases of poverty according to common definitions.
Findings
Of the 850 new therapeutic products registered in 2000–11, 37 (4\%) were indicated for neglected diseases, comprising 25 products with a new indication or formulation and eight vaccines or biological products. Only four new chemical entities were approved for neglected diseases (three for malaria, one for diarrhoeal disease), accounting for 1\% of the 336 new chemical entities approved during the study period. Of 148 445 clinical trials registered in Dec 31, 2011, only 2016 (1\%) were for neglected diseases.
Interpretation
Our findings show a persistent insufficiency in drug and vaccine development for neglected diseases. Nevertheless, these and other data show a slight improvement during the past 12 years in new therapeutics development and registration. However, for many neglected diseases, new therapeutic products urgently need to be developed and delivered to improve control and potentially achieve elimination.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: A significant reduction in parasite clearance rates following artesunate treatment of falciparum malaria, and increased failure rates following artemisinin combination treatments (ACT), signaled emergent artemisinin resistance in Western Cambodia. Accurate measurement of parasite clearance is therefore essential to assess the spread of artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum. The slope of the log-parasitaemia versus time relationship is considered to be the most robust measure of anti-malarial effect. However, an initial lag phase of numerical instability often precedes a steady exponential decline in the parasite count after the start of anti-malarial treatment.  This lag complicates the clearance estimation, introduces observer subjectivity, and may influence the accuracy and consistency of reported results.  METHODS: To address this problem, a new approach to modelling clearance of malaria parasites from parasitaemia-time profiles has been explored and validated. The methodology detects when a lag phase is present, selects the most appropriate model (linear, quadratic or cubic) to fit log-transformed parasite data, and calculates estimates of parasite clearance adjusted for this lag phase.  Departing from previous approaches, parasite counts below the level of detection are accounted for and not excluded from the calculation.  RESULTS: Data from large clinical studies with frequent parasite counts were examined. The effect of a lag phase on parasite clearance rate estimates is discussed, using individual patient data examples. As part of the World Wide Antimalarial Resistance Network's (WWARN) efforts to make innovative approaches available to the malaria community, an automated informatics tool: the parasite clearance estimator has been developed.  CONCLUSIONS: The parasite clearance estimator provides a consistent, reliable and accurate method to estimate the lag phase and malaria parasite clearance rate. It could be used to detect early signs of emerging resistance to artemisinin derivatives and other compounds which affect ring-stage clearance.},

After a single 2-h infusion of 2 mg of liposomal AMB/kg of body weight or 0.6 mg of AMB-DOC/kg, plasma, urine, and feces were collected for 168 h. The concentrations of AMB were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (plasma, urine, feces) or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (plasma). Infusion-related side effects similar to those reported in patients, including nausea and back pain, were observed in both groups. Both formulations had triphasic plasma profiles with long terminal half-lives (liposomal AMB, 152 ± 116 h; AMB-DOC, 127 ± 30 h), but plasma concentrations were higher (P {\textless} 0.01) after administration of liposomal AMB (maximum concentration of drug in serum [Cmax], 22.9 ± 10 μg/ml) than those of AMB-DOC (Cmax, 1.4 ± 0.2 μg/ml). Liposomal AMB had a central compartment volume close to that of plasma (50 ± 19 ml/kg) and a volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) (774 ± 550 ml/kg) smaller than the Vss of AMB-DOC (1,807 ± 239 ml/kg) (P {\textless} 0.01). Total clearances were similar (approximately 10 ml hr−1 kg−1), but renal and fecal clearances of liposomal AMB were 10-fold lower than those of AMB-DOC (P {\textless} 0.01). Two-thirds of the AMB-DOC was excreted unchanged in the urine (20.6\%) and feces (42.5\%) with {\textgreater}90\% accounted for in mass balance calculations at 1 week, suggesting that metabolism plays at most a minor role in AMB elimination. In contrast, {\textless}10\% of the liposomal AMB was excreted unchanged. No metabolites were observed by HPLC or mass spectrometry. In comparison to AMB-DOC, liposomal AMB produced higher plasma exposures and lower volumes of distribution and markedly decreased the excretion of unchanged drug in urine and feces. Thus, liposomal AMB significantly alters the excretion and mass balance of AMB. The ability of liposomes to sequester drugs in circulating liposomes and within deep tissue compartments may account for these differences.},

In this study, it was evaluated for applicability to detection of infections in dogs, a reservoir species. The reliability of the test was improved by treating the test sera with 0.2 M 2-mercaptoethanol and incubating them at 37 degrees C. Sensitivity was 100\% and specificity was 98.9\% when the test was used on serum samples from 220 dogs, including 26 with parasitologically confirmed canine leishmaniasis, 12 with suspected but unconfirmed leishmaniasis, and 182 with other conditions. The DAT detected specific antibodies in 10 dogs with canine leishmaniasis diagnosed by case history, clinical signs of leishmaniasis, and seropositivity in an immunofluorescence test using either promastigotes or amastigotes, as well as in 2 dogs suspected of having leishmaniasis. The performance of an antigen prepared from a homologous isolate of Leishmania infantum in the DAT was compared with that of an antigen from a laboratory-adapted strain of L. donovani (sensu lato). The homologous antigen compared favorably with the standard antigen, and the results provided further evidence of the potential of the DAT for detection of Leishmania infection in the canine reservoir host. The results of this study, together with those of our previous studies in human visceral leishmaniasis, demonstrate that the DAT is highly suitable for wide-scale epidemiological and ecological field work. This technique could also facilitate diagnosis of leishmaniasis in dogs in veterinary health services.},

Since the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy, the incidence of opportunistic infections has declined and the life expectancy of HIV-infected people has significantly increased. However, opportunistic infections, including fungal diseases, remain a leading cause of hospitalizations and mortality in HIV-infected people. With the availability of several new antiretroviral and antifungal agents, drug-drug interactions emerge as a potential safety concern.

AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW
Relevant literature was identified using a Medline search of articles published up to March 2010 and a review of conference abstracts. Search terms included HIV, antifungal agents and drug interactions. Original papers and relevant citations were considered for this review.

WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN
Readers will gain an understanding of the pharmacokinetic properties of antiretroviral and antifungal agents, and insight into significant drug-drug interactions which may require dosage adjustments or a change in therapy.

Azole antifungal drugs, with the exception of fluconazole, pose the greatest risk of two-way interactions with antiretroviral drugs through CYP450 enzymes effects. Limited studies suggest the risk of interactions between antiretroviral drugs and echinocandins is much lower. The combination of tenofovir and amphotericin B should be used with caution and close monitoring of renal function is required.},

	abstract = {The detection of antigen in the urine is increasingly being used for diagnosis of parasitic infections. A urinary antigen has recently been demonstrated in visceral leishmaniasis (VL), using a latex agglutination test. The results of our study show that the detected antigen is: heat-stable, precipitates with acetone and ethanol but not TCA, is sensitive to periodate and acid hydrolysis but not to pronase E, lipase, or neuraminidase. The antigen is a low molecular weight glycoconjugate that can be extracted by phenol-water, partitions into the aqueous phase when extracted with Triton X-114 or chloroform/methanol, and can be labelled by biotin hydrazide. Since this urinary antigen cannot be characterised by conventional SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, we used an affinity transfer blotting system in which antigens were captured onto nitro-cellulose paper previously coated with a specific antibody. Using this system a low molecular weight antigen (LMWA) spanning an area of the nitro-cellulose membrane corresponding to molecular weight of 5-20 kDa was detected in the urine of VL patients (from Nepal, Sudan, Brazil, Yemen and Spain) and of experimentally infected animals. No LMWA was detected in the urine of patients with malaria, schistosomiasis, or other nonparasitic diseases including typhoid and brucellosis. Immunoprecipitation, using antibody-coated latex, followed by immunoblotting showed that the LMWA is the target antigen in the previously described latex agglutination test ('KATEX'). The antigen is detectable in both the promastigote and amastigote stages of the parasite. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Leishmania glycoconjugates strongly react with this molecule. These results suggest that the detected antigen is highly specific and diagnostic for VL.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of individual participant data (IPD) aim to collect, check, and reanalyze individual-level data from all studies addressing a particular research question and are therefore considered a gold standard approach to evidence synthesis. They are likely to be used with increasing frequency as current initiatives to share clinical trial data gain momentum and may be particularly important in reviewing controversial therapeutic areas.
OBJECTIVE: To develop PRISMA-IPD as a stand-alone extension to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement, tailored to the specific requirements of reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of IPD. Although developed primarily for reviews of randomized trials, many items will apply in other contexts, including reviews of diagnosis and prognosis.
DESIGN: Development of PRISMA-IPD followed the EQUATOR Network framework guidance and used the existing standard PRISMA Statement as a starting point to draft additional relevant material. A web-based survey informed discussion at an international workshop that included researchers, clinicians, methodologists experienced in conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of IPD, and journal editors. The statement was drafted and iterative refinements were made by the project, advisory, and development groups. The PRISMA-IPD Development Group reached agreement on the PRISMA-IPD checklist and flow diagram by consensus.
FINDINGS: Compared with standard PRISMA, the PRISMA-IPD checklist includes 3 new items that address (1) methods of checking the integrity of the IPD (such as pattern of randomization, data consistency, baseline imbalance, and missing data), (2) reporting any important issues that emerge, and (3) exploring variation (such as whether certain types of individual benefit more from the intervention than others). A further additional item was created by reorganization of standard PRISMA items relating to interpreting results. Wording was modified in 23 items to reflect the IPD approach.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: PRISMA-IPD provides guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of IPD.},

	abstract = {Diagnostic material from patients with leishmaniasis is generally available as promastigotes, and proper testing for susceptibility to first-line drugs by the intracellular amastigote assay is frequently hampered by the poor infectivity of the promastigotes for the macrophage host cell. Several conditions for optimization of the in vitro metacyclogenesis and cell infectivity of Leishmania donovani, L. guyanensis, and L. braziliensis field strains obtained from patients receiving standard antimony medication were investigated. Triggering log-phase promastigotes to become amastigote-like by increasing the temperature or acidifying the culture medium was not successful. Adequate metacyclogenesis and the highest levels of macrophage infection were obtained after 5-day-old late-log-phase promastigote cultures were preconditioned at 25 degrees C to pH 5.4 for 24 h in Schneider's medium prior to infection. The susceptibility assay with primary peritoneal mouse macrophages included pentavalent antimony (Sb(V); sodium stibogluconate), trivalent antimony (Sb(III); potassium antimonyl tartrate), miltefosine, and the experimental drug PX-6518. All strains were sensitive to miltefosine (50\% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] {\textless} 10 microM) and PX-6518 (IC(50) {\textless} 2 microg/ml) but showed distinct susceptibility to Sb(V) and/or Sb(III), depending on whether they were derived from cured, relapse, or nonresponder patients. Within the available set of Leishmania species and strains, simultaneous Sb(V)-Sb(III) resistance was clearly associated with treatment failure; however, a larger set of isolates is still needed to judge the predictive value of Sb(V)-Sb(III) susceptibility profiling on treatment outcome. In conclusion, the proposed conditioning protocol further contributes toward a more standardized laboratory model for evaluation of the drug sensitivities of field isolates.},

Recently, two natural product peptides, argifin and argadin, have been characterized, which structurally mimic chitinase-chitooligosaccharide interactions and inhibit a bacterial chitinase in the nM-mM range. Here, we show that these inhibitors also act on human and Aspergillus fumigatus chitinases. The structures of these enzymes in complex with argifin and argadin, together with mutagenesis, fluorescence, and enzymology, reveal that subtle changes in the binding site dramatically affect affinity and selectivity.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Measurement of drug levels in plasma is currently the gold standard for pharmacological studies. However, venous sampling is not feasible in some populations (e.g., neonates) or may be difficult in certain situations, such as nonhospital-based settings. Dried blood spots (DBS) can be obtained by a simple fingerprick and the subsequent collection of blood on a filter card, allowing patient-friendly sample collection in non-hospital-based settings. Despite these advantages, thus far no clinical evaluation has been performed for the use of DBS concentrations as surrogates for plasma levels. Our purpose was to clinically evaluate DBS sampling for the determination of plasma concentrations for the novel antiretroviral drugs etravirine, darunavir/ritonavir and raltegravir.


RESULTS

DBS concentrations were measured in 11 HIV-infected patients using LC-MS/MS. DBS concentrations were proportional to plasma concentrations. All drug concentrations were higher in DBS than in plasma samples. The plasma:DBS ratio and the respective relative standard error of estimate (RSE) of darunavir, etravirine, raltegravir and ritonavir were 0.632 (4.97\% RSE), 0.523 (4.84\% RSE), 0.617 (14.9\% RSE) and 0.592 (2.99\% RSE), respectively. Hematocrit did not explain variability in our study.


CONCLUSIONS

DBS are reproducibly correlated to plasma levels and can be used for monitoring antiretroviral drug exposure in HIV-infected patients.},

We investigated the dynamics and predictive value of antibodies against insect-derived recombinant L. infantum proteins rKMPII and rTRYP by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with retrospective serum samples from 36 dogs during treatment of canine leishmaniasis. In the entire group of dogs, concentrations of antibodies against rKMPII and rTRYP significantly decreased earlier than concentrations of antibodies against crude total Leishmania antigen (one versus six months), which suggested that the dynamics of antibodies against recombinant proteins may be useful for assessing clinical improvement after treatment. Interestingly, decreases in antibody concentrations against rKMPII occurred earlier in disease-free dogs than in dogs that remain clinically ill one year after beginning of treatment, which suggested that these antibodies may be useful for predicting disease-free survival one year after the beginning of therapy against canine leishmaniasis.},

The authors therefore evaluated the PK of nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV) and lopinavir (LPV) in associations with nutritional status in a cohort of HIV-infected Ugandan children.
METHODS: Sparse dried blood spot samples from Ugandan children were used to estimate plasma concentrations. Historical PK data from children from 3 resource-rich countries (RRC) were utilized to develop the PK models.
RESULTS: Concentrations in 330 dried blood spot from 163 Ugandan children aged 0.7-7 years were analyzed in reference to plasma PK data (1189 samples) from 204 children from RRC aged 0.5-12 years. Among Ugandan children, 48\% was malnourished (underweight, thin or stunted). Compared to RRC, Ugandan children exhibited reduced bioavailability of EFV and LPV; 11\% (P = 0.045) and 18\% (P = 0.008), respectively. In contrast, NVP bioavailability was 46\% higher in Ugandan children (P {\textless} 0.001) with a trend toward greater bioavailability when malnourished. Children receiving LPV, EFV or NVP had comparable risk of virologic failure. Among children on NVP, low height and weight for age Z scores were associated with reduced risk of virologic failure (P = 0.034, P = 0.068, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Ugandan children demonstrated lower EFV and LPV and higher NVP exposure compared to children in RRC, perhaps reflecting the consequence of malnutrition on bioavailability. In children receiving NVP, the relation between exposure, malnutrition and outcome turned out to be marginally significant. Further investigations are warranted using more intensive PK measurements and adequate adherence assessments, to further assess causes of virologic failure in Ugandan children.},

We examined and characterized the pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in a group of patients with Old World (Leishmania major) cutaneous leishmaniasis. Miltefosine plasma concentrations were determined in samples taken during and up to 5 months after the end of treatment from 31 Dutch military personnel who contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and were treated with 150 mg miltefosine/day for 28 days. Samples were analyzed with a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 4 ng/ml. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed with nonlinear mixed-effect modeling, using NONMEM. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine could best be described by an open two-compartment disposition model, with a first elimination half-life of 7.05 days and a terminal elimination half-life of 30.9 days. The median concentration in the last week of treatment (days 22 to 28) was 30,800 ng/ml. The maximum duration of follow-up was 202 days after the start of treatment. All analyzed samples contained a concentration above the LLOQ. Miltefosine is eliminated from the body much slower than previously thought and is therefore still detectable in human plasma samples taken 5 to 6 months after the end of treatment. The presence of subtherapeutic miltefosine concentrations in the blood beyond 5 months after treatment might contribute to the selection of resistant parasites, and moreover, the measures for preventing the teratogenic risks of miltefosine treatment should be reconsidered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) limit the accumulation of antiretrovirals in cell lines but it is more important to know whether the expression of these transporters in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) impacts cellular drug concentrations. OBJECTIVES: To study the transport and accumulation of saquinavir (SQV) in PBMC and the effects of specific inhibitors of MRP1, MRP2, P-gp and BCRP. METHODS: Transport and accumulation of [H]-SQV was measured in PBMC in the absence or presence of specific and non-specific inhibitors of MRP1, MRP2, P-gp and BCRP. Flow cytometric, western blot and real-time PCR assays were used to examine the relative expression of the drug efflux transporters in the same batches of PBMC. RESULTS: MRP2 is present in PBMC. The expression of P-gp, MRP1, MRP2 (mRNA) and BCRP all displayed batch-to-batch variability. Specific and non-specific inhibitors of MRP1, P-gp and MRP2 significantly increased the baseline accumulation of SQV. Accumulation of SQV was not correlated with the expression of any single transporter. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple drug efflux transporters are important in the intracellular accumulation of SQV in PBMC. If drug efflux contributes towards virological failure, then all contributing transporters will need to be inhibited.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti-leishmanial drug regimens that include a single dose AmBisome could be suitable for eastern African patients with symptomatic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) but the appropriate single dose is unknown.
METHODOLOGY: A multi-centre, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial with an adaptive design, was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of a single dose and multiple doses of AmBisome for the treatment of VL in eastern Africa. The primary efficacy endpoint was definitive cure (DC) at 6 months. Symptomatic patients with parasitologically-confirmed, non-severe VL, received a single dose of AmBisome 7.5 mg/kg body weight or multiple doses, 7 times 3 mg/kg on days 1-5, 14, and 21. If interim analyses, evaluated 30 days after the start of treatment following 40 or 80 patients, showed the single dose gave significantly poorer parasite clearance than multiple doses at the 5\% significance level, the single dose was increased by 2·5 mg/kg. In a sub-set of patients, parasite clearance was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT) PCR.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The trial was terminated after the third interim analysis because of low efficacy of both regimens. Based on the intention-to-treat population, DC was 85\% (95\%CI 73-93\%), 40\% (95\%CI 19-64\%), and 58\% (95\%CI 41-73\%) in patients treated with multiple doses (n = 63), and single doses of 7·5 (n = 21) or 10 mg/kg (n = 40), respectively. qRT-PCR suggested superior parasite clearance with multiple doses as early as day 3. Safety data accorded with the drug label.
CONCLUSIONS: The tested AmBisome regimens would not be suitable for VL treatment across eastern Africa. An optimal single dose regimen was not identified.

	abstract = {Pharmacokinetic data consist of drug concentration measurements, as well as reports of some measured concentrations being below the quantification limit of the assay (BQL). A pharmacokinetic model may befit to these data, and for this purpose, the BQL observations must be either discarded or handled in a special way. In this paper, seven methods for dealing with BQL observations are evaluated. Both single-subject and population data are simulated from a one-compartment model. A moderate amount of data is simulated for each individual. The actual cv of concentration measurements at the quantification limit is assumed to be no greater than 20\%, in accord with the FDA Guidance. The results of this paper should be interpreted in this context. The methods include handling BQL observations as fixed-point censored observations, i.e., by using the likelihoods that these observations are in fact BQL. This method is shown to have some overall statistical advantage. However, the gain in using this method over that of simply discarding the BQL observations is not always much, and this is especially so when the frequency of BQL observations is small. Some simple methods entailing (i) replacing one or more BQL observations with the value 0, or (ii) replacing them with the value QL/2, where QL is the quantification limit, are also included. The first of these two approaches should not be used With population data, use of the second approach can result in some noticeably improved estimation of the typical value of a parameter, but then there is also marked degradation in the estimation of the population variance of the parameter.},

	abstract = {The Leishmania species cause a variety of human disease syndromes. Methods for diagnosis and species differentiation are insensitive and many require invasive sampling. Although quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods are reported for leishmania detection, no systematic method to quantify parasites and determine the species in clinical specimens is established. We developed a serial qPCR strategy to identify and rapidly differentiate Leishmania species and quantify parasites in clinical or environmental specimens. SYBR green qPCR is mainly employed, with corresponding TaqMan assays for validation. The screening primers recognize kinetoplast minicircle DNA of all Leishmania species. Species identification employs further qPCR set(s) individualized for geographic regions, combining species-discriminating probes with melt curve analysis. The assay was sufficient to detect Leishmania parasites, make species determinations, and quantify Leishmania spp. in sera, cutaneous biopsy specimens, or cultured isolates from subjects from Bangladesh or Brazil with different forms of leishmaniasis. The multicopy kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) probes were the most sensitive and useful for quantification based on promastigote standard curves. To test their validity for quantification, kDNA copy numbers were compared between Leishmania species, isolates, and life stages using qPCR. Maxicircle and minicircle copy numbers differed up to 6-fold between Leishmania species, but the differences were smaller between strains of the same species. Amastigote and promastigote leishmania life stages retained similar numbers of kDNA maxi- or minicircles. Thus, serial qPCR is useful for leishmania detection and species determination and for absolute quantification when compared to a standard curve from the same Leishmania species.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Leishmania tropica is the causative agent of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Iran. The disease often heals within a year; however, the non-healing forms of disease are also known. The aim of the present study was the determination of the levels of soluble (s) CD26 and CD30 co-stimulatory molecules in sera of L. tropica-infected individuals. The correlations of sCD26 and sCD30 levels with clinical presentation of the disease were assessed.


METHODS

The levels of sCD26 and sCD30 were determined by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in sera from patients with acute and non-healing presentation of disease.


RESULTS

The serum level of sCD26 was significantly higher in non-healing patients than in cases with acute CL (P{\textless}0.001). There was no significant difference in sCD26 level between patients with acute CL and healthy controls. However, the levels of sCD30 in sera from all L. tropica-infected individuals were higher than controls (P{\textless}0.001). A significant difference was also found in sCD30 level between non-healing cases and patients with acute CL (P{\textless}0.001).


CONCLUSION

These findings suggest sCD30 is more relevant to clinical manifestation of cutaneous leishmaniasis than sCD26. The high sCD26 and sCD30 levels in non-healing patients reflect the presence of mixed Th1- and Th2-type responses in these patients.},

	abstract = {Most studies on global health inequality consider unequal health care and socio-economic conditions but neglect inequality in the production of health knowledge relevant to addressing disease burden. We demonstrate this inequality and identify likely causes. Using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 111 prominent medical conditions, assessed globally and nationally by the World Health Organization, we linked DALYs with MEDLINE articles for each condition to assess the influence of DALY-based global disease burden, compared to the global market for treatment, on the production of relevant MEDLINE articles, systematic reviews, clinical trials and research using animal models vs. humans. We then explored how DALYs, wealth, and the production of research within countries correlate with this global pattern. We show that global DALYs for each condition had a small, significant  negative  relationship with the production of each type of MEDLINE articles for that condition. Local processes of health research appear to be behind this. Clinical trials and animal studies but not systematic reviews produced within countries were strongly guided by local DALYs. More and less developed countries had very different disease profiles and rich countries publish much more than poor countries. Accordingly, conditions common to developed countries garnered more clinical research than those common to less developed countries. Many of the health needs in less developed countries do not attract attention among developed country researchers who produce the vast majority of global health knowledge—including clinical trials—in response to their own local needs. This raises concern about the amount of knowledge relevant to poor populations deficient in their own research infrastructure. We recommend measures to address this critical dimension of global health inequality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Parasites' evolution in response to parasite-targeted control strategies, such as vaccines and drugs, is known to be influenced by their population genetic structure. The aim of this study was to describe the population structure of Ethiopian strains of Leishmania donovani derived from different areas endemic for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) as a prerequisite for the design of effective control strategies against the disease.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS

Sixty-three strains of L. donovani newly isolated from VL cases in the two main Ethiopian foci, in the north Ethiopia (NE) and south Ethiopia (SE) of the country were investigated by using 14 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers. The microsatellite profiles of 60 previously analysed L. donovani strains from Sudan, Kenya and India were included for comparison. Multilocus microsatellite typing placed strains from SE and Kenya (n = 30) in one population and strains from NE and Sudan (n = 65) in another. These two East African populations corresponded to the areas of distribution of two different sand fly vectors. In NE and Sudan Phlebotomus orientalis has been implicated to transmit the parasites and in SE and Kenya P. martini. The genetic differences between parasites from NE and SE are also congruent with some phenotypic differences. Each of these populations was further divided into two subpopulations. Interestingly, in one of the subpopulations of the population NE we observed predominance of strains isolated from HIV-VL co-infected patients and of strains with putative hybrid genotypes. Furthermore, high inbreeding irreconcilable from strict clonal reproduction was found for strains from SE and Kenya indicating a mixed-mating system.


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE

This study identified a hierarchical population structure of L. donovani in East Africa. The existence of two main, genetically and geographically separated, populations could reflect different parasite-vector associations, different ecologies and varying host backgrounds and should be further investigated.},

Mice with an inactivating knock-in mutation in the p110δ isoform of PI3K (referred to as p110δD910A) show severely impaired T cell responses. Because a strong T cell response is thought to mediate resistance to intracellular pathogens, we examined the outcome of L. major infection in p110δD910A mice. Paradoxically, p110δD910A mice on “resistant” and “susceptible” genetic backgrounds showed more robust resistance manifested as significantly reduced lesion size and accelerated parasite clearance. This enhanced resistance was associated with dramatically diminished immune responses, including impaired cell proliferation and effector cytokine (IFN-γ and TNF) production. Interestingly, the ability of macrophages and dendritic cells from p110δD910A mice to produce NO and destroy Leishmania parasites was similar to those of wild-type mice. We show that the enhanced resistance of p110δD910A mice was due to impaired expansion and effector functions of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Adoptive transfer studies demonstrated that p110δD910A mice lost their increased resistance when given enriched Tregs from wild-type mice. We suggest on the basis of these and further observations that the lack of this enzyme prominently affects Treg expansion and homing to infection sites, and that in the absence of Tregs, weak Th1 responses are capable of containing parasites and prevent pathology. We also suggest that temporary pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme may be a very effective form of treatment against cutaneous leishmaniasis.},

By the first approach, Coomassie-stained protein bands (32- and 33-kDa fractions) that specifically reacted by immunoblotting with sera from MVL patients were excised from the gel and submitted to enzymatic digestion to generate peptides. Four peptides were sequenced, three of which were shown to be definitely associated with MVL-reactive antigens and ascribed to a mitochondrial integral ADP-ATP carrier protein from L. major, a putative NADH cytochrome b(5) reductase, and a putative mitochondrial carrier protein, respectively. The second approach combined two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of membrane antigens and mass spectrometry (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry) by using a quadrupole time-of-flight analysis. Six immunoreactive spots that resolved within a molecular mass range of 30 to 36 kDa and a pH range of 6.7 to 7.4 corresponded to four Leishmania products. The sequences derived from two spots were ascribed to a beta subunit-like guanine nucleotide binding protein, known as the activated protein kinase C receptor homolog antigen LACK, and to a probable member of the aldehyde reductase family. One spot was identified as a probable ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (EC 1.10.2.2) Rieske iron-sulfur protein precursor. The remaining three spots were identified as truncated forms of elongation factor 1alpha. These antigens correspond to conserved proteins ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells and represent potential candidates for the design of a reliable tool for the diagnosis of this disease.},

We investigated the sensitivity of MDR1 -expressing cells to treatment with miltefosine. We show that cells overexpressing MDR1 (NCI/ADR-RES, KB-8-5, KB-C1, CCRF/VCR1000, CCRF/ADR5000) were less sensitive to miltefosine treatment when compared to the sensitive parental cell lines. HeLa cells transfected with MDR1 exhibited resistance to the compound, indicating that expression of this gene is sufficient to reduce the sensitivity to miltefosine. The resistance of MDR1 -expressing cells to miltefosine was less pronounced than that to adriamycin or vinblastine. Expression of MDR2 did not correlate with the resistance to miltefosine. As shown by a fluorescence quenching assay using MIANS-labelled P-glycoprotein (PGP), miltefosine bound to PGP with a K d of approximately 7 μM and inhibited PGP-ATPase activity with an IC 50 of approximately 35 μM. Verapamil was not able to reverse the resistance to miltefosine. Concentrations of miltefosine up to approximately 60 μM stimulated, whereas higher concentrations inhibited the transport of [3H]-colchicine with an IC 50 of approximately 297 μM. Binding studies indicated that miltefosine seems to interact with the transmembrane domain and not the cytosolic nucleotide-binding domain of PGP. These data indicate that expression of MDR1 may reduce the response to miltefosine in patients and that this compound interacts with PGP in a manner different from a number of other substrates. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign www.bjcancer.com},

Despite T-cell-dependent immune responses, which produce asymptomatic and self-healing infection, or appropriate treatment, intracellular infection is probably life-long since targeted cells (tissue macrophages) allow residual parasites to persist. There is an epidemic of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and Pakistan and of visceral infection in India and Sudan. Diagnosis relies on visualising parasites in tissue or serology; culture and detection of parasite DNA are useful in the laboratory. Pentavalent antimony is the conventional treatment; however, resistance of visceral infection in India has spawned new treatment approaches--amphotericin B and its lipid formulations, injectable paromomycin, and oral miltefosine. Despite tangible advances in diagnosis, treatment, and basic scientific research, leishmaniasis is embedded in poverty and neglected.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

There is no effective oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), a disseminated intracellular protozoal infection that occurs worldwide. Miltefosine, an alkyl phospholipid developed as an oral antineoplastic agent, is active against visceral infection in animal models. We tested safety, tolerance, and efficacy of miltefosine in kala-azar.


METHODS

Oral doses of miltefosine were given to six groups of five Indian men for 28 days: 50 mg every second day (group 1), 100 mg every second day (group 2), 100 mg/day (group 3), 150 mg/day (group 4), 200 mg/day (group 5), and 250 mg/day (group 6). Assessment for apparent cure--taken as an afebrile state with decreased spleen size and a splenic-aspirate parasite-density score of 0--was done on days 14 and 28. Definitive cure at 8 months required a parasite-free bone-marrow aspirate and no clinical evidence of relapse.


FINDINGS

21 of 30 patients were apparently cured on day 14. Transient episodes of vomiting and diarrhoea, were common during weeks 1-2 and were seen in 22 patients. Four other patients in groups 5 and 6 had miltefosine withdrawn after 7-10 days because of vomiting. One patient in group 6 developed renal insufficiency and severe diarrhoea and died on day 21. On day 28, all 29 remaining patients were apparently cured. By 8 months, seven of ten patients in groups 1 and 2 had relapsed; however, 18 of 19 patients treated daily (groups 3-6) appeared to be cured. Among the 21 definitive cures were the four patients treated for 10 days or less and 12 for whom previous therapy with pentavalent antimony had failed.


INTERPRETATION

Treatment with miltefosine at 100-150 mg/day for 4 weeks has promise as an effective oral treatment of visceral leishmaniasis including antimony-resistant infection.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: protein energy malnutrition (PEM) is a nutritional problem affecting many children world-wide. Its association with a wide spectrum of infections necessitates multiple drug therapies. A systematic review was performed to determine the effects of PEM on drug pharmacokinetics.
METHODS: literature searches in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (January 1960 to December 2009) were performed. Malnutrition, undernutrition, underweight, protein-energy malnutrition, protein-calorie malnutrition, marasmus, marasmic-kwashiorkor or kwashiorkor was the medical subject heading (MeSH) descriptor used. Inclusion criteria were abstracts that assessed or discussed absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, clearance, pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of drugs, except micronutrients and appetite-stimulating drugs.
RESULTS: altogether, 41 publications were identified. A total of 34 drugs were studied. The absorption of 18 drugs was studied; the extent of absorption (AUC) was unaffected for 10 drugs. The plasma protein binding of 20 drugs was evaluated; it was significantly reduced for 12 drugs. The volume of distribution (Vd) of 13 drugs was evaluated; it was, however, unaffected for most of the drugs. The effect of PEM on total clearance and the half-life of drugs primarily metabolised by the liver was studied for 8 drugs. There was decreased total clearance and an associated increased half-life of 5 drugs. For 2 drugs (chloramphenicol and quinine), different degrees of PEM affected total clearance differently. The total clearance of six drugs primarily eliminated by the kidneys was studied; it was unaffected for four drugs, but significantly decreased for two drugs (cefoxitin and penicillin).
CONCLUSIONS: considering the proportion of children affected with PEM world-wide, there have been relatively few pharmacokinetic studies of drugs frequently used for their treatment. More studies are therefore required to establish the appropriate dose and safety of these drugs for PEM children. The studies need to recognise that PEM is a disease spectrum and should further look at the differential effects of kwashiorkor and marasmus on drug pharmacokinetics in children.},

Additional information was collated during meetings conducted at WHO regional level between 2007 and 2011. Two questionnaires regarding epidemiology and drug access were completed by experts and national program managers. Visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis incidence ranges were estimated by country and epidemiological region based on reported incidence, underreporting rates if available, and the judgment of national and international experts. Based on these estimates, approximately 0.2 to 0.4 cases and 0.7 to 1.2 million VL and CL cases, respectively, occur each year. More than 90\% of global VL cases occur in six countries: India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Brazil. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is more widely distributed, with about one-third of cases occurring in each of three epidemiological regions, the Americas, the Mediterranean basin, and western Asia from the Middle East to Central Asia. The ten countries with the highest estimated case counts, Afghanistan, Algeria, Colombia, Brazil, Iran, Syria, Ethiopia, North Sudan, Costa Rica and Peru, together account for 70 to 75\% of global estimated CL incidence. Mortality data were extremely sparse and generally represent hospital-based deaths only. Using an overall case-fatality rate of 10\%, we reach a tentative estimate of 20,000 to 40,000 leishmaniasis deaths per year. Although the information is very poor in a number of countries, this is the first in-depth exercise to better estimate the real impact of leishmaniasis. These data should help to define control strategies and reinforce leishmaniasis advocacy.},

Miltefosine, an alkyl phospholipid has been found effective against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in adults in various studies. The authors safety, tolerance and efficacy of Miltefosine and compared with available gold standard anti-Ieishmanial drug, Amphotericin B, a parenteral formulation in children with VL.


METHODS

All consecutive children aged 1 yr to 14 yr, presented with fever, splenomegaly and positive LD body in splenic smear examination, admitted in pediatric ward of Nalanda Medical college and Child care center between 1st July 03 to 30th June 05 were taken for study. Patients were randomized into four groups. Group-l and 2 patients were given Miltefosine in dose of 2.5 mg/Kg day o.d. or b.i.d. per orally to a maxiIpum of 100 mg and group 3 and 4 Amphotericin B at a dose of 1 mg/Kg/day (total: 15 mg/Kg). All patients were followed at completion of therapy, 3 months and 6 months for clinical response, splenic size and parasitologically.


RESULTS

Out of 125 children, 44 were in group-I, 20 in group-2, 38 in group-3 and 23 in group- 4, 124 patients had parasitological cure with relapse in one patient of group 1 during follow up. One patient in-group II had no response with first course but became parasitologically negative with 2nd course of Miltefosine. In-group I, one patient had persistent splenomegaly and found to have associated portal hypertension. Final cure rate with Miltefosine and Amphotericin B was 93.2\%, 95\%, 92.1\% and 91.3\% in-group 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively, which are statistically insignificant. Majority of patients had pancytopenia. Eievated". AL T ({\textgreater}3 times of normal) were seen in 28, 11, 19 and 13 patients of group 1, 2, 3 and group 4 respectively which returned to normal in subsequent follow up. Raised BUN was observed more in patients who got Amphotericin B i.e. 65.42\% and 73.91 \% in-group 3 and 4 respectively. GI side effects i.e. diarrhea and vomiting were observed in 26 and 23 patients in-group 1 and 2 respectively.


CONCLUSION

Miltefosine is safe, well tolerable, and highly effective and has same efficacy as Amphotericin B in newly diagnosed and SAG resistant children with visceral leishmaniasis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Cutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by a parasitic infection and is considered one of the most serious skin diseases in many developing countries. Antimonials are the most commonly prescribed treatment but other drugs have been used with varying success.


OBJECTIVES

To assess the effects of treatments for Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis (OWCL).


SEARCH STRATEGY

We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (April 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2008), MEDLINE (2003-April 2008), EMBASE (2005-April 2008), CINAHL (1982-August 2007), LILACS (from inception to April 2008) and ongoing trials databases (August 2007).


SELECTION CRITERIA

Randomised controlled trials assessing treatments in immuno-competent people with OWCL confirmed by smear, histology, culture or polymerase chain reaction.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.


MAIN RESULTS

We included 49 trials involving 5559 participants. Reporting quality was generally poor and only two studies contained sufficiently similar data to pool.In Leishmania major infections, there was good RCT evidence of benefit of cure around 3 months after treatment when compared to placebo for 200 mg oral fluconazole (1 RCT n = 200, RR 2.78; 95\% CI 1.86, 4.16), topical 15\% paromomycin + 12\% methylbenzethonium chloride (PR-MBCL) (1 RCT n = 60, RR 3.09; 95\% CI 1.14, 8.37) and photodynamic therapy (1 RCT n = 60, RR 7.02; 95\% CI 3.80, 17.55). Topical PR-MBCL was less efficacious than photodynamic therapy (1 RCT n = 65, RR 0.44; 95\% CI 0.29, 0.66). Oral pentoxifylline was a good adjuvant therapy to intramuscular meglumine antimoniate (IMMA) when compared to IMMA plus placebo (1 RCT n = 64, RR 1.63; 95\% CI 1.11, 2.39)In Leishmania tropica infections, there was good evidence of benefit for the use of 200 mg oral itraconazole for 6 weeks compared with placebo (1 RCT n = 20, RR 7.00; 95\% CI 1.04, 46.95), for intralesional sodium stibogluconate (1 RCT n = 292, RR 2.62; 95\% CI 1.78, 3.86), and for thermotherapy compared with intramuscular sodium stibogluconate (1 RCT n = 283, RR 2.99; 95\% CI 2.04, 4.37).


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS

Most trials have been designed and reported poorly, resulting in a lack of evidence for potentially beneficial treatments. There is a desperate need for large well conducted studies that evaluate long-term effects of current therapies. We suggest the creation of an international platform to improve quality and standardization of future trials in order to inform clinical practice.},

HePC shows a broad spectrum of biological effects in various cells in vitro and in vivo. It has pronounced antiproliferative effects on neoplastic cells. The molecular mechanism by which HePC exerts its biological effects is still under investigation. By generating a HePC-resistant cell variant of the lymphoma cell line Raji, we established a model to investigate which molecular mechanism may be responsible for the antiproliferative action of HePC. Here we present data showing that HePC substantially interferes with the metabolism of cellular phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS) in the human lymphoma cell line Raji. HePC leads to an inhibition of PC synthesis via CDP-choline and as a compensatory mechanism enhances the generation of PC via PS indicating that the reduced PC synthesis seems to significantly disturb cellular homeostasis. In HePC-resistant Raji cells, PC synthesis via CDP-choline is constitutively less active and is not further reduced by HePC. Resistant Raji cells do not seem to use the alternative pathway of PC synthesis via PS nor can this be induced by HePC. The resistance mechanism may therefore be independent of cell membrane metabolism.},

Meglumine antimonate increased the number of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ingested by monocyte and the percentage of these cells engaged in phagocytosis, which resulted in an increase of the monocyte phagocytic index by 158\%. Meglumine antimonate also increased the number of S. cerevisiae ingested by neutrophil and the percentage of these cells engaged in phagocytosis, increasing the neutrophil phagocytic index by 219\%. The median of percent reduction of NBT was significantly increased after treatment with this pentavalent antimony from 89.5\% to 96.5\%. Meglumine antimonate had no influence on nitric oxide production, but it significantly increased the mean ± SEM production of tumor necrosis factor by 230\%. However, monocytes incubated with TNF significantly increased NO production. This antimonial increased the phagocytic capacity of monocytes and neutrophils and enhanced superoxide anion production by phagocytes, which represent the first line of defense against the parasite. Furthermore, meglumine antimonate increased TNF, and via this cytokine, it may also indirectly increase NO production. Our data suggest that these immunomodulatory effects of meglumine antimonate may play a role in fighting leishmania and that meglumine antimonate provides the phagocytes with a mechanism that prevents leishmania from escaping immune defense. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Improved treatment approaches are needed for visceral leishmaniasis. We assessed the efficacy and safety of three potential short-course combination treatments compared with the standard monotherapy in India.


METHODS

Standard treatment (1 mg/kg amphotericin B infusion on alternate days for 30 days, total dose 15 mg/kg) was compared with three drug combinations (single injection of 5 mg/kg liposomal amphotericin B and 7-day 50 mg oral miltefosine or single 10-day 11 mg/kg intramuscular paromomycin; or 10 days each of miltefosine and paromomycin) in an open-label, parallel-group, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial in two hospital sites in Bihar, India. Patients aged 5-60 years with parasitologically confirmed visceral leishmaniasis were randomly assigned one of the four treatments by the trial statistician by use of a computer-generated list. Clinical assessments were done at the end of treatment (15 days on combination treatment; 31 days for standard treatment) and after 45 days and 6 months. The primary endpoint was definitive cure (defined as no sign or symptom of visceral leishmaniasis and parasitologically cured to the last follow-up). Analyses were done both by intention to treat and per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00696969.


FINDINGS

Between June, 2008, and July, 2009, 634 patients were assigned amphotericin B (n=157), liposomal amphotericin B with miltefosine (n=160) or paromomycin (n=158), or miltefosine and paromomycin (n=159). 618 patients were in the per-protocol population. There were two relapses in each group. The numbers with definitive cure at 6 months for the intention-to-treat population were 146 (cure rate 93·0\%; CI 87·5-96·3) for amphotericin B, 156 (97·5\%; 93·3-99·2) for liposomal amphotericin B and miltefosine, 154 (97·5\%; 93·24-99·2) for liposomal amphotericin B and paromomycin, and 157 (98·7\%; 95·1-99·8) for miltefosine and paromomycin. All combinations were non-inferior to the standard treatment, in both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. Patients in the combination groups had fewer adverse events than did those assigned standard treatment.


INTERPRETATION

Combination treatments for visceral leishmaniasis are efficacious and safe, and decrease the duration of therapy, thereby encouraging adherence and reducing emergence of drug-resistant parasites.

	abstract = {The clinical value of amphotericin B, the mainstay therapy for visceral leishmaniasis in sodium antimony gluconate-nonresponsive zones of Bihar, India, is now threatened by the emergence of acquired drug resistance, and a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms is the need of the hour. We have selected an amphotericin B-resistant clinical isolate which demonstrated 8-fold-higher 50\% lethal doses (LD(50)) than an amphotericin B-sensitive strain to explore the mechanism of amphotericin B resistance. Fluorimetric analysis demonstrated lower anisotropy in the motion of the diphenylhexatriene fluorescent probe in the resistant strain, which indicated a higher fluidity of the membrane for the resistant strain than for the sensitive strain. The expression patterns of the two transcripts of S-adenosyl-l-methionine:C-24-Δ-sterol methyltransferase and the absence of ergosterol, replaced by cholesta-5,7,24-trien-3β-ol in the membrane of the resistant parasite, indicate a decreased amphotericin B affinity, which is evidenced by decreased amphotericin B uptake. The expression level of MDR1 is found to be higher in the resistant strain, suggesting a higher rate of efflux of amphotericin B. The resistant parasite also possesses an upregulated tryparedoxin cascade and a more-reduced intracellular thiol level, which helps in better scavenging of reactive oxygen species produced by amphotericin B. The resistance to amphotericin B was partially reverted by the thiol metabolic pathway and ABC transporter inhibitors. Thus, it can be concluded that altered membrane composition, ATP-binding cassette transporters, and an upregulated thiol metabolic pathway have a role in conferring amphotericin B resistance in clinical isolates of Leishmania donovani.},

	abstract = {Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is a membrane-bound molecule that is primarily involved in cell to cell adhesive interactions of the immune system. Concentrations of soluble ICAM-1 (s-ICAM-1) shed into the circulation were measured by a quantitative ELISA in HIV-infected persons without AIDS, patients with AIDS with or without evidence of acute opportunistic infection at the time of sampling, and HIV-seronegative patients with toxoplasmosis, community-acquired pneumonia, leishmaniasis and rickettsial infections. Patients were classified on the basis of clinical condition and CD4+ T-cell counts according to the 1993 revised HIV classification of the USA Centers for Disease Control. Concentrations of s-ICAM-1 in the serum of HIV-infected persons without AIDS-indicator conditions (categories A1, A2, B1 and B2) as well as in the serum of patients with AIDS (categories A3, B3, C1, C2 and C3) were significantly higher than normal (mean +/- S.E.M. 469 +/- 23, n = 60 and 780 +/- 73, n = 56, respectively, versus 329 +/- 15 ng/ml, P {\textless} 0.0001 and {\textless} 0.0001 respectively) and differed also significantly from each other (P {\textless} 0.0001). Raised concentrations of s-ICAM-1 in the serum of afebrile patients with AIDS but without acute opportunistic infection at the time of sampling (mean +/- S.E.M. 672 +/- 76, n = 29) did not differ from those of the remaining patients with AIDS or from those of HIV-seronegative patients with the infections studied. A steady and significant increase of serum concentrations of s-ICAM-1 with progress of disease according to clinical category (categories A--{\textgreater}B--{\textgreater}C, p = 0.0007) as well as with the loss of circulating CD4+ T-cells (categories 1--{\textgreater}2--{\textgreater}3, p = 0.009) was observed. Individual serum concentrations of s-ICAM-1 showed negative correlations with individual total lymphocyte (P = 0.004), CD4+ T-cell (P = 0.05), CD8+ T-cell counts (P = 0.03) as well as positive correlation with serum concentrations of soluble interleukin-2 receptors (P {\textless} 0.0001), an indirect marker of progress of HIV-related disease. Serum concentrations of s-ICAM-1 did not differ between patients with AIDS who were receiving or not receiving zidovudine at the time of sampling. A longitudinal survey is needed in order to determine whether measuring serum concentrations of s-ICAM-1, although not specific, has any predictive or prognostic value in these patients as well as whether this bioactive molecule has any pathogenetic role in the progress of disease in HIV infection.},

Cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major is often a self-healing disease; however, persistent nonhealing forms are also known. In the present study, we have described cell-mediated immune responses in nonhealing patients by measuring T-cell proliferation, cytokine production, and phenotypic characterization of these cells. The responses were compared with those of patients with active lesions, patients who had recovered from infection, and healthy controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with active lesions and recovered donors proliferated vigorously and produced Th1-type cytokine when stimulated with L. major antigens, whereas in nonhealing patients the proliferative responses were significantly lower and showed a Th2-type response to Leishmania antigens. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) production was not a feature of L. major stimulation. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that L. major antigen induced proliferation of the CD4-positive population and that these cells were the major source of gamma interferon and IL-4. These results show a distinct dichotomy in the cytokine response to L. major infection.},

When a nested ITS1-PCR was used its sensitivity equaled the ssu-rDNA-PCR. Digestion of ITS1 amplicon with the restriction enzyme HaeIII distinguished all medically relevant Leishmania species. ITS1-PCR was used to diagnose 162 local and imported suspected cases of leishmaniasis in Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Germany. 113 cases (69.7\%) were positive by PCR and species identification was possible in 110 samples.

	abstract = {Human phagocyte-specific chitotriosidase is associated with several diseases involving macrophage activation. Since macrophage activation plays an important role in the control of Mycobacterium leprae infection, we studied the association of chitotriosidase with leprosy both in serum and in situ in lesional skin biopsies from patients. Serum samples from 78 Indonesian leprosy patients (39 non-reactional and 39 reactional leprosy patients) and 36 healthy controls (HC) from the same endemic region were investigated. The patients were classified as multibacillary (MB, n=69) or paucibacillary (PB, n=9) based on the bacterial index in slit-skin smears. Thirty-six of the reactional patients had erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), while only 3 had reversal reaction (RR). Follow-up serum samples after corticosteroid treatment were also obtained from 17 patients with ENL and one with RR. Multibacillary (MB) patients showed increased chitotriosidase activity in serum as compared to paucibacillary (PB) patients and healthy controls. Although no significant difference was observed between reactional and the corresponding non-reactional groups, ENL showed significantly higher chitotriosidase activity as compared to HC. Furthermore, corticosteroid treatment resulted in significant decline of enzyme activity in ENL sera. Chitotriosidase activity correlated with levels of neopterin, another macrophage activation marker, but not with IL-6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-10. Immunohistochemical staining of 6 MB (LL=5, BL=1) lesional skin sections from stored material showed positive staining for chitotriosidase within lipid-laden macrophages suggesting that macrophages are the source of the enzyme detected in serum. Thus, serum chitotriosidase activity is potentially useful in distinguishing MB from PB leprosy and in monitoring response to therapy in ENL.},

However, the use and application of molecular assays are increasing, but comparative studies on the performance of these different assays are lacking. The aim of this study was to compare three molecular assays for detection and quantification of Leishmania parasites in serial dilutions of parasites and in skin biopsies collected from cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) patients in Manaus, Brazil. A serial dilution of promastigotes spiked in blood was tested in triplicate in three different runs by quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA), quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). In addition, the costs, durations, and numbers of handling steps were compared, and 84 skin biopsies from patients with suspected CL were tested. Both QT-NASBA and qRT-PCR had a detection limit of 100 parasites/ml of blood, while qPCR detected 1,000 parasites/ml. QT-NASBA had the lowest range of intra-assay variation (coefficients of variation [CV], 0.5\% to 3.3\%), while qPCR had the lowest range of interassay variation (CV, 0.4\% to 5.3\%). Furthermore, qRT-PCR had higher r2 values and amplification efficiencies than qPCR, and qPCR and qRT-PCR had faster procedures than QT-NASBA. All assays performed equally well with patient samples, with significant correlations between parasite counts. Overall, qRT-PCR is preferred over QT-NASBA and qPCR as the most optimal diagnostic assay for quantification of Leishmania parasites, since it was highly sensitive and reproducible and the procedure was relatively fast.},

In vivo natural killer cell activity was measured by chromium release of YAC-1 cells using spleen cells from treated animals as effector cells. Miltefosine had no significant effect on YAC-1 cytolysis. Similarly, the compound did not induce cytotoxic spleen cells against KB target cells. The results were identical when spleen cells from tumour-bearing animals were used. Humoral antibody production in rats following sheep red blood cell immunization was not changed by miltefosine pretreatment. Finally, the in vitro phagocytic activity of mouse bone marrow macrophages was not stimulated but rather inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, there is no experimental evidence that the miltefosine action is mediated by the host immune system and no major immunotoxicity was observed.},

	abstract = {Background
Genetic polymorphisms in the complex gene cluster encoding human Fc-gamma receptors (FcγRs) may influence malaria susceptibility and pathogenesis. Studying genetic susceptibility to malaria is ideal among sympatric populations because the distribution of polymorphic genes among such populations can help in the identification malaria candidate genes. This study determined the distribution of three FcyRs single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (FcγRIIB-rs1050519, FcγRIIC-rs3933769 and FcγRIIIA-rs396991) among sympatric Fulani and Dogon children with uncomplicated malaria. The association of these SNPs with clinical, malariometric and immunological indices was also tested.

Methods
This study involved 242 Fulani and Dogon volunteers from Mali age under 15 years. All SNPs were genotyped with predesigned TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assays. Genotypic and allelic distribution of SNPs was compared across ethnic groups using the Fisher exact test. Variations in clinical, malariometric and immunologic indices between groups were tested with Kruskal–Wallis H, Mann–Whitney U test and Fisher exact test where appropriate.

Results
The study confirmed known malariometric and immunologic differences between sympatric Fulani and non-Fulani tribes. Parasite density was lower in the Fulani than the Dogon (p {\textless} 0.0001). The mutant allele of FcγRIIC (rs3933769) was found more frequently in the Fulani than the Dogon (p {\textless} 0.0001) while that of FcγRIIIA (rs396991) occurred less frequently in the Fulani than Dogon (p = 0.0043). The difference in the mutant allele frequency of FcγRIIB (rs1050519) between the two ethnic groups was however not statistically significant (p = 0.064). The mutant allele of rs396991 was associated with high malaria-specific IgG1 and IgG3 in the entire study population and Dogon tribe, p = 0.023 and 0.015, respectively. Parasite burden was lower in carriers of the FcγRIIC (rs3933769) mutant allele than non-carriers in the entire study population (p {\textless} 0.0001). Carriers of this allele harboured less than half the parasites found in non-carriers.

Conclusion
Differences in the allelic frequencies of rs3933769 and rs396991 among Fulani and Dogon indirectly suggest that these SNPs may influence malaria susceptibility and pathogenesis in the study population. The high frequency of the FcγRIIC (rs3933769) mutant allele in the Fulani and its subsequent association with low parasite burden in the entire study population is noteworthy.},

Incubation with bloodstream trypomastigotes resulted, under different experimental conditions, in higher activity of the compounds in comparison with crystal violet. The ED(50)/24 h values were 13.4+/-2.8 microM and 11. 7+/-0.6 microM for amastigotes and epimastigotes, respectively. ET-18-OCH(3) (0.3 and 0.6 microM) inhibited the differentiation of epimastigotes to trypomastigotes (Dm28C clone) in the range 40-57\%. This drug (3.75-15 microM) also caused a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of the intracellular proliferation of amastigotes in heart muscle cells with ED(50) values of 14.3+/-4.2, 8.9+/-1.9 and 6. 8+/-0.4 microM, after 1, 2 and 3 days of treatment. Pre-treatment of the parasite with this drug inhibited its interiorization into the host cell. Interestingly, the intracellular differentiation of amastigotes to trypomastigotes was not hampered by the drug. The present results demonstrate the lytic effect of ALPs on the three forms of T. cruzi, as well as the inhibition of both the differentiation to the infective form and the proliferation of parasites interiorized in heart cells. Ultrastructural analysis of epimastigotes treated with the three ALPs showed extensive blebing of the flagellar membrane. As described in tumour cells, the membrane seems to be a primary target of the drugs.},

We investigated miltefosine, which can be taken orally, for the treatment of Indian visceral leishmaniasis. Miltefosine is a phosphocholine analogue that affects cell-signaling pathways and membrane synthesis. METHODS: The study was an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 trial in which four 30-person cohorts received 50, 100, or 150 mg of miltefosine per day for four or six weeks. The 120 patients, who ranged in age from 12 to 50 years, had anorexia, fever, and splenomegaly with at least moderate (2+) leishmania in a splenic aspirate. A parasitologic cure was defined by the absence of parasites in a splenic aspirate obtained two weeks after completion of treatment. The clinical response was assessed at six months. RESULTS: In all 120 patients there was an initial parasitologic cure. Six patients had clinical and parasitologic relapses; the remaining 114 patients had not relapsed by six months after treatment, for a cure rate of 95 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 89 to 98 percent). With the regimen of 100 mg of miltefosine per day (approximately 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) for four weeks, 29 of 30 patients (97 percent) were cured. Gastrointestinal side effects were frequent (occurring in 62 percent of patients) but mild to moderate in severity, and no patient discontinued therapy because of gastrointestinal side effects. In two patients, treatment was discontinued because of elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase or creatinine; in both patients the levels rapidly returned to normal. In 12 other patients, the level of aspartate aminotransferase increased to 100 to 150 U per liter during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered miltefosine appears to be an effective treatment for Indian visceral leishmaniasis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

We report cloning and characterization of a novel Leishmania infantum protein which we termed Lepp12, and we examine its possible implication in the interference with intramacrophage signaling pathways.


RESULTS

The protein Lepp12 contains 87 amino acid sequence and exhibits 5 potential phosphorylation sites by protein kinase C (PKC). Recombinant GST-Lepp12 is phosphorylated in vitro by exogenous PKC and by PKC-like activities present in promastigote and in the myelomonocytic THP-1 cell line, indicating that at least one phosphorylation site is functional on the recombinant Lepp12. The natural Lepp12 protein is present in L. infantum promastigotes, as evidenced using specific anti-Lepp12 antibodies produced by immunopurification from acute phase VL patient sera. Interestingly, human patient sera are strongly reactive with GST-Lepp12, demonstrating immunogenic properties of Lepp12 in man, but no immune response to Lepp12 is detectable in experimentally infected animals. When isolated from promastigotes, Lepp12 migrates as two species of apparent MW of 18.3 kDa (major) and 14 kDa (minor), localizes in the nuclear fraction and appears constitutively phosphorylated. Natural Lepp12 is phosphorylable in vitro by both exogenous PKC and PKC-like activity present in THP-1 extracts. The intracellular Lepp12 transfected into THP-1 cells activates these cells to produce IL-1beta and induces an enhancing effect on PMA stimulated IL-1beta synthesis, as demonstrated using GST-Lepp12 transfectants.


CONCLUSIONS

Together these results indicate that Lepp12 represents a substrate for PKC or other PKC-like activities present in the promastigote form and the host cell and therefore may interfere with signal transduction pathways involving PKC.},

Against the axenically grown epimastigote form of the parasite, the IC50s after 120 h for ET-18-OCH3, miltefosine and ilmofosine were 3, 1 and 3 μM, respectively; at higher concentrations immediate lytic effects were observed. Eradication of the intracellular amastigote, grown inside Vero cells, was achieved at 0.1, 0.1 and 1 μM for ET-18-OCH3, miltefosine and ilmofosine, respectively. Analysis of the lipid composition of epimastigotes exposed to LPAs at their IC50 for 120 h showed that the ratio of phosphatidyl-choline (PC) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) changed from 1.5 in control cells to c. 0.67 in those treated with the analogues. A significant increase in the content of phosphatidylserine was also observed in treated cells. Intact epimastigotes efficiently incorporated radioactivity from l-[methyl-14C]methionine into PC, but not from [methyl-14C]choline. ET-18-OCH3 inhibited the incorporation of l-[methyl-14C]methionine into PC with an IC50 of 2 μM, suggesting that inhibition of the de novo synthesis through the Greenberg's pathway was a primary effect underlying the selective anti-parasitic activity of this compound. Antiproliferative synergism was observed as a consequence of combined treatment of epimastigotes with ET-18-OCH3 and ketoconazole, a sterol biosynthesis inhibitor, probably due to the fact that a secondary effect of the latter is also a blockade of PC synthesis at the level of PE-PC-N-methyl-transferase.},

Unacceptable treatment regimens and increasing drug resistance blight control programmes. The success of oral miltefosine in VL prompted a clinical, histopathological and parasitological study of this drug in PKDL.
OBJECTIVES: To define the dose and duration of miltefosine for treatment of PKDL.
METHODS: Twenty-six patients confirmed by slit-skin smear, histopathology and molecular tests were enrolled in the study. They received miltefosine capsules 50 mg thrice daily after food. Treatment was for 60 days with a provision to increase by 30 days if a responder had not attained a cure. Cure was ascertained by clinical and histopathological examination, and measuring parasite burden using real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with a wide range of parasite burden completed the study. Twenty-three achieved a cure giving an initial cure rate of 96\% (95\% confidence interval 79-99\%). Sixteen patients were cured with 50 mg thrice daily, 13 in 60 days and three within 90 days. In seven cases, miltefosine had to be reduced, because of gastrointestinal intolerance, to 50 mg twice daily to a total of 180 capsules. Lesional parasites were undetectable at 1 month post-treatment. Treatment was safe with no relapses at 1-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Oral miltefosine, 50mg thrice daily for 60 days or twice daily for 90 days, could be an effective treatment for PKDL.},

Clinical and parasitological parameters were reassessed at the end of treatment and 6 months later. One patient died of intercurrent pneumonia on day 6. The other 79 patients demonstrated no parasites after treatment, had marked clinical improvement, and were deemed initially cured. Three patients had relapse, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. The final cure rate was 94\% for all enrolled patients and 95\% for evaluable patients.

This trial indicates that miltefosine is as effective and well tolerated in Indian children with VL as in adults and that it can be recommended as the first choice for treatment of childhood VL in India.},

	abstract = {Together with vector control, chemotherapy is an essential tool for the control of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), but its efficacy is jeopardized by growing resistance and treatment failure against first-line drugs. To delay the emergence of resistance, the use of drug combinations of existing antileishmanial agents has been tested systematically in clinical trials for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). In vitro, Leishmania donovani promastigotes are able to develop experimental resistance to several combinations of different antileishmanial drugs after 10 weeks of drug pressure. Using an untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics approach, we identified metabolic changes in lines that were experimentally resistant to drug combinations and their respective single-resistant lines. This highlighted both collective metabolic changes (found in all combination therapy-resistant [CTR] lines) and specific ones (found in certain CTR lines). We demonstrated that single-resistant and CTR parasite cell lines show distinct metabolic adaptations, which all converge on the same defensive mechanisms that were experimentally validated: protection against drug-induced and external oxidative stress and changes in membrane fluidity. The membrane fluidity changes were accompanied by changes in drug uptake only in the lines that were resistant against drug combinations with antimonials, and surprisingly, drug accumulation was higher in these lines. Together, these results highlight the importance and the central role of protection against oxidative stress in the different resistant lines. Ultimately, these phenotypic changes might interfere with the mode of action of all drugs that are currently used for the treatment of VL and should be taken into account in drug development.},

	abstract = {In an exploration of the natural history of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), 134 residents of Sudan who had recently been diagnosed as cases of the disease were investigated. In each case, diagnosis had been based on clinical criteria, the temporal relationship between the rash and the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), positive results in direct agglutination tests (DAT) and/or leishmanin skin tests (LST), and the exclusion of other skin conditions. The mean (S.D.) age of the subjects was 6.4 (3.0) years. Although PKDL appeared commonest among those aged 4-8 years (P {\textless} 0.05), it was most severe in children aged {\textless}or= 3 years. Males and females were equally affected. The rash developed 0.5-13 months following the apparently successful treatment of VL, a relatively rapid onset being associated with severe disease (P = 0.01). The distribution of the rash on the body often reflected the clothing habits of the case, being most frequent on skin that was regularly exposed to the sun. Spontaneous healing of the lesions occurred within 12 months in the majority of cases, the PKDL lasting for a mean (S.D.) of 9.7 (4.7) months. Persistence of lesions beyond 1 year was significantly associated with the combination of a high titre in the DAT and a negative result in the LST (P {\textless} 0.05). In conclusion, spontaneous healing is commonly seen in Sudanese patients with PKDL. Persistence of the lesions is frequently associated with non-reactivity in the LST and high levels of anti-leishmanial antibodies.},

Over 60\% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis in Bihar State, India, do not respond to treatment with pentavalent antimonials. This is now considered to be due to acquired resistance. Although this class of drugs has been used for over 60 years for leishmaniasis treatment, it is only in the past 2 years that the mechanisms of action and resistance have been identified, related to drug metabolism, thiol metabolism, and drug efflux.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

American cutaneous leishmaniasis is considered to be a zoonotic disease transmitted by sand flies that feed on infected sylvatic mammals. However, the "domestication" of transmission and the increase in treatment failure with antimonial drugs have raised the suspicion of anthroponotic transmission of American cutaneous leishmaniasis.


METHODS

The objective of the present study was to explore the potential of humans as a source of infection for sand flies. Biological (xenodiagnosis and culture) and molecular (polymerase chain reaction/Southern blot) detection methods were used to evaluate peripheral-blood monocytes and tissue fluids from sites accessible to sand flies from 59 adult patients with parasitologically confirmed American cutaneous leishmaniasis.


RESULTS

Overall, 44.1\% of patients (26/59) presented biological and/or molecular evidence of Leishmania parasites in normal skin, peripheral-blood monocytes, lesion scars, or lesion border (by xenodiagnosis) before (18/59 [30.5\%]) or after (10/27 [37.0\%]) treatment. Leishmania parasites were cultured from the unaffected skin of 2 (3.6\%) of 55 patients, and xenodiagnosis gave positive results for 5 (8.8\%) of 57 patients before treatment.


CONCLUSIONS

The presence of Leishmania parasites in the unaffected skin and peripheral-blood monocytes of a high proportion of patients even after treatment and the acquisition of infection by sand flies support the plausibility of anthroponotic transmission of American cutaneous leishmaniasis.},

	abstract = {Except in rare cases, the stomach can withstand exposure to highly concentrated hydrochloric acid, refluxed bile salts, alcohol, and foodstuffs with a wide range of temperatures and osmolarity. This is attributed to a number of physiological responses by the mucosal lining to potentially harmful luminal agents, and to an ability to rapidly repair damage when it does occur. Since the discovery in 1971 that prostaglandin synthesis could be blocked by aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), there has been great interest in the contribution of prostaglandins to gastric mucosal defense. Prostaglandins modulate virtually every aspect of mucosal defense, and the importance of this contribution is evident by the increased susceptibility of the stomach to injury following ingestion of an NSAID. With chronic ingestion of these drugs, the development of ulcers in the stomach is a significant clinical concern. Research over the past two decades has helped to identify some of the key events triggered by NSAIDs that contribute to ulcer formation and/or impair ulcer healing. Recent research has also highlighted the fact that the protective functions of prostaglandins in the stomach can be carried out by other mediators, in particular the gaseous mediators nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide. Better understanding of the mechanisms through which the stomach is able to resist injury in the presence of luminal irritants is helping to drive the development of safer anti-inflammatory drugs, and therapies to accelerate and improve the quality of ulcer healing.},

	abstract = {Leishmania infantum is the causative agent of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (VL). If untreated the disease could be fatal; however, in some cases the infection can run a subclinical course. In subclinical infections a Th1-response predominates, while Th2-responses and/or probably Treg cells are related to unfavourable outcome of the disease in active VL. In the present study we determined the levels of soluble (s) CD26 and CD30 co-stimulatory molecules in sera from patients with active VL, asymptomatic individuals and healthy volunteers. Results showed a significant difference in both sCD26 and sCD30 between infected cases and normal individuals (P {\textless} or = 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in sCD26 levels between asymptomatic cases and patients, although the difference was not significant. sCD30 levels were significantly higher in VL patients than asymptomatic cases (P {\textless} or = 0.001). These findings suggest a possible association between sCD26 and sCD30 levels and the clinical manifestation of L. infantum infection.},

	abstract = {Ether-lipid (alkyl-phospholipid) analogues such as Miltefosine possess potent in vitro and in vivo anti-leishmanial activity and these compounds are currently undergoing clinical trials in humans. These analogues are also effective against Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei subspecies but their mode of action is not known. Leishmania have high levels of ether-lipids and these are mainly found in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycolipids and glycoproteins present on the surface of the parasites. In Leishmania mexicana promastigotes we have studied both the initiating steps for the biosynthesis of ether-lipids, and key remodelling steps. The effect of Miltefosine and Edelfosine, on key enzymes involved in the metabolism of ether-lipids has been studied. The enzymes include dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase, sn-l-acyl-2-lyso-glycero-3-phosphocholine and sn-l-alkyl-2-lyso-glycero-3-phosphocholine acyltransferases. We confirm that the initiating steps in ether-lipid metabolism in Leishmania are present in glycosomes, and that Miltefosine or Edelfosine did not perturb these enzymes. The metabolism of the latter phosphatidylcholine base intermediates, which may be involved in the remodelling of acyl- and alkyl-glycerophospholipids, was also seemingly associated with glycosomes. Both Miltefosine and Edelfosine inhibited this microbody (glycosomal) located alkyl-specific-acyl-CoA acyltransferase in a dose-dependent manner with an inhibitory concentration of 50 microM. It is suggested therefore that a perturbation of ether-lipid remodelling could be responsible for the anti-leishmanial action of these drugs.},

	abstract = {Informative diagnostic tools are vital to the development of useful mixed-effects models. The Visual Predictive Check (VPC) is a popular tool for evaluating the performance of population PK and PKPD models. Ideally, a VPC will diagnose both the fixed and random effects in a mixed-effects model. In many cases, this can be done by comparing different percentiles of the observed data to percentiles of simulated data, generally grouped together within bins of an independent variable. However, the diagnostic value of a VPC can be hampered by binning across a large variability in dose and/or influential covariates. VPCs can also be misleading if applied to data following adaptive designs such as dose adjustments. The prediction-corrected VPC (pcVPC) offers a solution to these problems while retaining the visual interpretation of the traditional VPC. In a pcVPC, the variability coming from binning across independent variables is removed by normalizing the observed and simulated dependent variable based on the typical population prediction for the median independent variable in the bin. The principal benefit with the pcVPC has been explored by application to both simulated and real examples of PK and PKPD models. The investigated examples demonstrate that pcVPCs have an enhanced ability to diagnose model misspecification especially with respect to random effects models in a range of situations. The pcVPC was in contrast to traditional VPCs shown to be readily applicable to data from studies with a priori and/or a posteriori dose adaptations.},

	abstract = {Leflunomide is the first disease-modifying antirheumatic drug to be approved for rheumatoid arthritis in the past 10 years. Orally administered leflunomide is almost completely converted into its active metabolite A77 1726 (hereafter referred to as M1). M1 displays linear pharmacokinetics at the dosages of leflunomide used in clinical practice. It has a long elimination half-life (approximately 2 weeks), reaching a steady state after approximately 20 weeks. M1 is highly bound to plasma proteins. The pharmacokinetics of M1 are not affected by food intake, and dosage requirements are not influenced by age or gender. Approximately 90\% of a single dose of leflunomide is eliminated, 43\% in urine, primarily as leflunomide glucuronides and an oxalinic acid derivative of M1, and 48\% in faeces, primarily as M1. Elimination can be dramatically increased by using charcoal or cholestyramine. In vitro studies have shown no major influence of leflunomide on the metabolism of analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and methotrexate, drugs usually used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In clinical studies with a limited number of patients using these drugs concomitantly, no safety problems appeared. Nonspecific inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and some drugs metabolised by CYP2C9 affect the metabolism of M1, and caution should be used in patients cotreated with them. Additional in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies are needed to better understand the nonenzymatic and enzymatic metabolism of leflunomide. Additional clinical trials should be performed in order to find new indications for leflunomide in other autoimmune diseases, and new combination therapeutic strategies in rheumatoid arthritis. This review is a summary of current knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of leflunomide, focusing primarily on humans and in particular on patients with rheumatoid arthritis.},

When overexpressed, this half-transporter confers significant resistance to the leishmanicidal agents miltefosine and sitamaquine. This resistance phenotype is mediated by a reduction in intracellular drug accumulation. LiABCG6 also reduces the accumulation of short-chain fluorescent phospholipid analogues of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine.

	abstract = {PURPOSE

Population model analyses have shifted from using the first order (FO) to the first-order with conditional estimation (FOCE) approximation to the true model. However, the weighted residuals (WRES), a common diagnostic tool used to test for model misspecification, are calculated using the FO approximation. Utilizing WRES with the FOCE method may lead to misguided model development/evaluation. We present a new diagnostic tool, the conditional weighted residuals (CWRES), which are calculated based on the FOCE approximation.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

CWRES are calculated as the FOCE approximated difference between an individual's data and the model prediction of that data divided by the root of the covariance of the data given the model.


RESULTS

Using real and simulated data the CWRES distributions behave as theoretically expected under the correct model. In contrast, in certain circumstances, the WRES have distributions that greatly deviate from the expected, falsely indicating model misspecification. CWRES/WRES comparisons can also indicate if the FOCE estimation method will improve the results of an FO model fit to data.


CONCLUSIONS

Utilization of CWRES could improve model development and evaluation and give a more accurate picture of if and when a model is misspecified when using the FO or FOCE methods.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

The clinical and epidemiological significance of Leishmania DNA in extralesional sites is obscured by uncertainty of whether the DNA derives from viable parasites. To examine dissemination of Leishmania during active disease and the potential participation of human infection in transmission, Leishmania 7SLRNA was exploited to establish viability and estimate parasite burden in extralesional sites of dermal leishmaniasis patients.


METHODS

The feasibility of discriminating parasite viability by PCR of Leishmania 7SLRNA was evaluated in relation with luciferase activity of luc transfected intracellular amastigotes in dose-response assays of Glucantime cytotoxicity. Monocytes, tonsil swabs, aspirates of normal skin and lesions of 28 cutaneous and 2 mucocutaneous leishmaniasis patients were screened by kDNA amplification/Southern blot. Positive samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR of Leishmania 7SLRNA genes and transcripts.


RESULTS

7SLRNA amplification coincided with luciferase activity, confirming discrimination of parasite viability. Of 22 patients presenting kDNA in extralesional samples, Leishmania 7SLRNA genes or transcripts were detected in one or more kDNA positive samples in 100\% and 73\% of patients, respectively. Gene and transcript copy number amplified from extralesional tissues were comparable to lesions. 7SLRNA transcripts were detected in 13/19 (68\%) monocyte samples, 5/12 (42\%) tonsil swabs, 4/11 (36\%) normal skin aspirates, and 22/25 (88\%) lesions; genes were quantifiable in 15/19 (79\%) monocyte samples, 12/13 (92\%) tonsil swabs, 8/11 (73\%) normal skin aspirates.


CONCLUSION

Viable parasites are present in extralesional sites, including blood monocytes, tonsils and normal skin of dermal leishmaniasis patients. Leishmania 7SLRNA is an informative target for clinical and epidemiologic investigations of human leishmaniasis.},

Manifestations range from asymptomatic infection to disseminated visceral disease. Literature reports suggest that both genetic and environmental factors influence the outcome of infection. Due to the association of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) locus with other infectious diseases, we examined whether polymorphic alleles at this locus are associated with the outcome of L. chagasi infection. Neighborhoods with ongoing transmission were identified through patients admitted to local hospitals. Altogether, 1,024 individuals from 183 families were classified with the following disease phenotypes: (i) symptomatic VL, (ii) asymptomatic infection (positive delayed-type hypersensitivity [DTH+]), or (iii) no evidence of infection (DTH-). Genotypes were determined at a microsatellite marker (MSM) upstream of the TNFB gene encoding TNF-beta and at a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) at position -307 in the promoter of the TNFA gene encoding TNF-alpha. Analyses showed that the distribution of TNFA RFLP alleles (TNF1 and TNF2) and the TNF MSM alleles (TNFa1 to TNFa15) differed between individuals with VL and those with DTH+ phenotypes. TNF1 was transmitted more frequently than expected from heterozygous parents to DTH+ offspring (P = 0.0006), and haplotypes containing TNF2 were associated with symptomatic VL (P = 0.0265, transmission disequilibrium test). Resting serum TNF-alpha levels were higher in TNF1/2 heterozygotes than in TNF1/1 homozygotes (P {\textless} 0.05). These data led us to hypothesize that an individual's genotype at the TNF locus may be associated with whether he or she develops asymptomatic or symptomatic disease after L. chagasi infection. The results preliminarily suggest that this may be the case, and follow-up with larger populations is needed for verification.},

To further explore the pharmacological factors associated with these treatment failures, a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study was performed to examine the relationship between miltefosine drug exposure and treatment failure in a cohort of Nepalese patients with VL.
METHODS: Miltefosine steady-state blood concentrations at the end of treatment were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling and a logistic regression model. Individual estimates of miltefosine exposure were explored for their relationship with treatment failure.
RESULTS: The overall probability of treatment failure was 21\%. The time that the blood concentration was {\textgreater}10 times the half maximal effective concentration of miltefosine (median, 30.2 days) was significantly associated with treatment failure: each 1-day decrease in miltefosine exposure was associated with a 1.08-fold (95\% confidence interval, 1.01-1.17) increased odds of treatment failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Achieving a sufficient exposure to miltefosine is a significant and critical factor for VL treatment success, suggesting an urgent need to evaluate the recently proposed optimal allometric miltefosine dosing regimen. This study establishes the first evidence for a drug exposure-effect relationship for miltefosine in the treatment of VL.},

We used mathematical modeling to identify drug exposure targets for meropenem in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of mice with Pseudomonas pneumonia driving substantial [2 to 3 log10 (CFU/g)] killing and which suppressed resistant subpopulation amplification. We bridged to humans to estimate the frequency with which the largest licensed meropenem dose would achieve these exposure targets. Cell kills of 2 and 3 log10 (CFU/g) and resistant subpopulation suppression were mediated by achieving time {\textgreater} MIC in ELF of 32\%, 50\%, and 50\%. Substantial variability in meropenem's ability to penetrate into ELF of both mice and humans was observed. Penetration variability and high exposure targets combined to prevent even the largest licensed meropenem dose from achieving the targets at an acceptable frequency. Even a highly potent agent such as meropenem does not adequately suppress resistant subpopulation amplification as single-agent therapy administered at maximal dose and optimal schedule. Combination chemotherapy is likely required in humans if we are to minimize resistance emergence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. This combination needs evaluation both in the murine pneumonia model and in humans.},

MIL is an oral drug with a long half-life, and it is feared that resistance may emerge rapidly, threatening control efforts under the VL elimination program. There is an urgent need for monitoring treatment efficacy and emergence of drug resistance in the field. In a set of VL/PKDL cases recruited for MIL treatment, we observed comparable drug susceptibility in pre- and post-treatment isolates from cured VL patients while MIL susceptibility was significantly reduced in isolates from VL relapse and PKDL cases. The PKDL isolates showed higher tolerance to MIL as compared to VL isolates. Both VL and PKDL isolates were uniformly susceptible to PMM. MIL transporter genes LdMT/LdRos3 were previously reported as potential resistance markers in strains in which MIL resistance was experimentally induced. The point mutations and the down-regulated expression of these transporters observed in vitro could, however, not be verified in natural populations of parasites. LdMT/LdRos3 genes therefore, do not appear to be suitable markers so far for monitoring drug susceptibility in clinical leishmanial isolates.},

More rarely it can be related to an immunotolerence status such as pregnancy. Various observations report the development of leishmaniasis several months or even years after exposure to the parasite. Relapses occur rarely in patients not known to be immunocompromised, but are common after incomplete treatment. They are frequent in patients with Leishmania/HIV co-infection. Asymptomatic phases and relapses suggest that parasite can exist in the tissues for a long time before and/or after clinical onset of the disease. The mechanisms of onset of clinical leishmaniasis following exposure and infestation are highly relevant to understanding the pathology of the disease. The survival of Leishmania parasite between infection and disease or after cure is a very important issue for clinicians and epidemiologists. We describe two cases of VL occurring in a patient with lymphoma and in a pregnant woman. In both cases, parasites remained present in the lymph nodes after clinical cure.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accumulation of macrophages in multiple organs is a common feature of sarcoidosis and Gaucher disease. The vast number of storage macrophages in Gaucher patients has facilitated the discovery of suitable plasma markers like chitotriosidase and CCL18.
METHODS: Plasma specimens of patients with sarcoidosis were examined on chitotriosidase activity and CCL18 protein levels.
RESULTS: Chitotriosidase was markedly increased, being on average 13.7-fold elevated (range: 1.1-43.3). The sensitivity of demonstrating sarcoidosis using plasma chitotriosidase values exceeded that using serum angiotensin-converting enzyme values. A 3.5-fold (range: 1-15) increase in CCL18 was also observed. The relative changes in chitotriosidase and CCL18 during the course of disease closely mimicked each other, suggesting an identical cellular source. In situ hybridization analysis confirmed massive production of chitotriosidase by sarcoid macrophages. The increase in plasma chitotriosidase correlated with the stage of disease, being highest in active sarcoidosis with extrapulmonary involvement. Therapy with steroids resulted in clear reduction of plasma chitotriosidase and CCL18 and relapse of disease activity was preceded by increases in these parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Sarcoid macrophages secrete high quantities of chitotriosidase and CCL18. Determination of plasma chitotriosidase and CCL18 may be useful to monitor changes in granulomatous macrophages during the course of sarcoidosis.},

Moreover, a simple, rapid and inexpensive colorimetric test was developed and evaluated for the detection of miltefosine in pharmaceutical products that can be used in the field. The complementary analytical techniques presented here were able to determine qualitatively or (semi-)quantitatively the presence or absence of miltefosine in pharmaceutical preparations and could identify suspected counterfeit miltefosine capsules.

Metabolic studies in both Raji and L1210 leukemic cells on OM-GPC, 3H-labeled in the methyl groups of the choline moiety, showed a (diacyl)-phosphatidylcholine as the only labeled metabolite. Since the formation of radiolabeled (diacyl)-phosphatidylcholine showed a direct correlation with cell death, we tested other lipid analogs. One of these compounds, hexadecylphosphocholine (He-PC), which was 3H-labeled in the methyl-choline groups, showed a formation of labeled (diacyl)-phosphatidylcholine similar to that found with OM-GPC. Again, there was a direct linear correlation between the formation of the labeled product and cell death. He-PC was found to be a potent cell toxin in in vitro experiments on cell cultures. However, analogs with an elongated phosphor to trimethylammonium distance showed no toxicity towards the cells in in vitro experiments. From the data, we conclude that the ether phospholipids are substrates for a phospholipase C or related enzyme.

Clearance in the paediatric population should be investigated using models that describe size, maturation and organ function influences. Size is the primary covariate and although lean body weight is argued as a better measure than total body weight, the use of different fractions of fat mass to explain how pharmacokinetic parameters vary with body composition has been proposed. Allometric scaling using an empiric power exponent of 3/4 is superior to scaling using body surface area. The sigmoid hyperbolic model has proven useful to describe maturation. An extra parameter that describes asymmetry can be incorporated into this model. These descriptors are used to illustrate creatinine, morphine and paracetamol clearance in children. Simultaneous investigation of pooled GFR, paracetamol and morphine data enabled testing for shared common features of maturation processes. Results suggest that GFR matures before paracetamol or morphine clearance, consistent with phase II conjugation processes that convert xenobiotics to water soluble forms that can subsequently be eliminated from the body through the renal system. The use of such mechanistic approaches improves understanding of paediatric pharmacokinetics; improving dosing predictions and allowing projection in exploratory drug development.},

Ninety-two serum samples, including 30 patients with active kala-azar (KA), 17 post-treated KA patients (KA-PT), 20 post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) patients and 25 controls, were analysed for rLepp12, rK39 and DAT positivity. All KA samples taken at pre-treatment stage were positive for Lepp12 antibodies. Seventeen of these were evaluated post treatment (KA-PT), 10 of which were found to be negative. Nine of these 10 negative cases corresponded to clinically cured patients with regressed spleen. Seven post-treatment cases were rLepp12-positive; all of them corresponded to patients who were considered clinically cured but continued to have an enlarged spleen ({\textgreater} or =5 cm). The majority of PKDL patients (18/20) were found to be seronegative by immunoblot test using rLepp12 antigen. The rLepp12-based Western blot diagnosed 100\% of patients with visceral disease, whilst none of the control cases were found to be reactive to rLepp12. rLepp12 protein provides a useful reagent for highly sensitive and specific diagnosis of KA. Additionally, rLepp12 appears to have potential as a prognostic marker for the infection.},

	abstract = {Increased amounts of neopterin are produced by human monocytes/macrophages upon stimulation with the cytokine interferon-y. Therefore, measurement of neopterin concentrations in body fluids like serum, cerebrospinal fluid or urine provides information about activation of T helper cell 1 derived cellular immune activation. Increased neopterin production is found in infections by viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), infections by intracellular living bacteria and parasites, autoimmune diseases, malignant tumor diseases and in allograft rejection episodes. But also in neurological and in cardiovascular diseases cellular immune activation indicated by increased neopterin production, is found. Major diagnostic applications of neopterin measurements are, e.g. monitoring of allograft recipients to recognize immunological complications early. Neopterin production provides prognostic information in patients with malignant tumor diseases and in HIV-infected individuals, high levels being associated with poorer survival expectations. Neopterin measurements are also useful to monitor therapy in patients with autoimmune disorders and in individuals with HIV infection. Screening of neopterin concentrations in blood donations allows to detect acute infections in a non-specific way and improves safety of blood transfusions. As high neopterin production is associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species and with low serum concentrations of antioxidants like alpha-tocopherol, neopterin can also be regarded as a marker of reactive oxygen species formed by the activated cellular immune system. Therefore, by neopterin measurements not only the extent of cellular immune activation but also the extent of oxidative stress can be estimated.},

To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the OligoC-TesT and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification coupled to oligochromatography (NASBA-OC) for molecular detection of Leishmania in blood from patients with confirmed visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and healthy endemic controls from Kenya.


METHODS

Blood specimens of 84 patients with confirmed VL and 98 endemic healthy controls from Baringo district in Kenya were submitted to both assays.


RESULTS

The Leishmania OligoC-TesT showed a sensitivity of 96.4\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 90-98.8\%) and a specificity of 88.8\% (95\% CI: 81-93.6\%), while the sensitivity and specificity of the NASBA-OC were 79.8\% (95\% CI: 67-87\%) and 100\% (95\% CI: 96.3-100\%), respectively.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

It is uncertain whether Leishmania parasites ever disappear after clinical cure of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL). Recently, sensitive molecular techniques have allowed the identification of Leishmania parasites directly in specimens from patients' scars.


METHODS

Scars of 32 patients from northeastern Brazil who were treated and clinically cured of ACL were analyzed by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture, and histopathologic examination.


RESULTS

DNA specific for Leishmania (Viannia) was detected in scars of 30 (93.7\%) of 32 patients. In specimens from 3 of the scars, Leishmania parasites could be isolated by culture; PCR results also were positive for those 3 specimens. No parasites were found by histopathologic examination, and fibrotic alterations were present in all cases, with slight inflammatory foci observed in 4 of the cases studied.


CONCLUSIONS

The results suggest that clinical cure of ACL is rarely associated with sterile cure. The implications of persistence of parasites for the clinical evolution, relapse, and transmission of leishmaniasis deserves further studies, particularly with the increasing incidence of coinfection with leishmaniasis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.},

Sulbactam, a potent inhibitor of β-lactamases, was previously shown to be active against A. baumannii strains in vitro and effective against A. baumannii infections. However, a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis of sulbactam against A. baumannii infections has not yet been performed. This is necessary because optimisation of dosing regimens should be based on PK/PD analysis. Therefore, in vitro and in vivo PK/PD analyses of sulbactam were performed using murine thigh and lung infection models of A. baumannii to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sulbactam. Sulbactam showed time-dependent bactericidal activity in vitro against A. baumannii. The PK/PD index that best correlated with its in vivo effects was the time that the free drug concentration remained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (fT{\textgreater}MIC) both in the thigh (R(2)=0.95) and lung (R(2)=0.96) infection models. Values of fT{\textgreater}MIC for a static effect and 1, 2 and 3log10 kill, respectively, were 21.0\%, 32.9\%, 43.6\% and 57.3\% in the thigh infection model and 20.4\%, 24.5\%, 29.3\% and 37.3\% in the lung infection model. Here we report the in vitro and in vivo time-dependent activities of sulbactam against A. baumannii infection and demonstrate that sulbactam was sufficiently bactericidal when an fT{\textgreater}MIC of {\textgreater}60\% against A. baumannii thigh infection and {\textgreater}40\% against A. baumannii lung infection was achieved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Economic growth in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) has raised interest in how disease burden patterns are related to economic development. Meanwhile, poverty-related diseases are considered to be neglected in terms of research and development (R\&D).
OBJECTIVES: Developing intuitive and meaningful metrics to measure how different diseases are related to poverty and neglected in the current R\&D system.
DESIGN: We measured how diseases are related to economic development with the income relation factor (IRF), defined by the ratio of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) per 100,000 inhabitants in LMIC versus that in high-income countries. We calculated the IRF for 291 diseases and injuries and 67 risk factors included in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010. We measured neglect in R\&D with the neglect factor (NF), defined by the ratio of disease burden in DALYs (as percentage of the total global disease burden) and R\&D expenditure (as percentage of total global health-related R\&D expenditure) for 26 diseases.
RESULTS: The disease burden varies considerably with the level of economic development, shown by the IRF (median: 1.38; interquartile range (IQR): 0.79-6.3). Comparison of IRFs from 1990 to 2010 highlights general patterns of the global epidemiological transition. The 26 poverty-related diseases included in our analysis of neglect in R\&D are responsible for 13.8\% of the global disease burden, but receive only 1.34\% of global health-related R\&D expenditure. Within this group, the NF varies considerably (median: 19; IQR: 6-52).
CONCLUSIONS: The IRF is an intuitive and meaningful metric to highlight shifts in global disease burden patterns. A large shortfall exists in global R\&D spending for poverty-related and neglected diseases, with strong variations between diseases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alternative treatments for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) are required in East Africa. Paromomycin sulphate (PM) has been shown to be efficacious for VL treatment in India.
METHODS: A multi-centre randomized-controlled trial (RCT) to compare efficacy and safety of PM (20 mg/kg/day for 21 days) and PM plus sodium stibogluconate (SSG) combination (PM, 15 mg/kg/day and SSG, 20 mg/kg/day for 17 days) with SSG (20 mg/kg/day for 30 days) for treatment of VL in East Africa. Patients aged 4-60 years with parasitologically confirmed VL were enrolled, excluding patients with contraindications. Primary and secondary efficacy outcomes were parasite clearance at 6-months follow-up and end of treatment, respectively. Safety was assessed mainly using adverse event (AE) data.
FINDINGS: The PM versus SSG comparison enrolled 205 patients per arm with primary efficacy data available for 198 and 200 patients respectively. The SSG \& PM versus SSG comparison enrolled 381 and 386 patients per arm respectively, with primary efficacy data available for 359 patients per arm. In Intention-to-Treat complete-case analyses, the efficacy of PM was significantly lower than SSG (84.3\% versus 94.1\%, difference = 9.7\%, 95\% confidence interval, CI: 3.6 to 15.7\%, p = 0.002). The efficacy of SSG \& PM was comparable to SSG (91.4\% versus 93.9\%, difference = 2.5\%, 95\% CI: -1.3 to 6.3\%, p = 0.198). End of treatment efficacy results were very similar. There were no apparent differences in the safety profile of the three treatment regimens.
CONCLUSION: The 17 day SSG \& PM combination treatment had a good safety profile and was similar in efficacy to the standard 30 day SSG treatment, suggesting suitability for VL treatment in East Africa.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Although mucosal leishmaniasis is a prominent disease, it has been studied only to a limited extent. It is classically treated with parenteral antimony or, as a last resort, amphotericin B.


METHODS

We treated Bolivian mucosal leishmaniasis due to Leishmania braziliensis with the oral agent miltefosine, 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days, and followed-up for 12 months.


RESULTS

Seventy-two patients were evaluable. The cure rate for the 36 patients who had "mild" disease (i.e., affecting nasal skin and nasal mucosa) was 83\%. The cure rate for the 36 patients who had more extensive disease (involving the palate, pharynx, and larynx) was 58\%. Patients refused to be randomized to parenteral agents, but the cure rate for an almost contemporary group who was receiving amphotericin B (45 mg/kg over 90 days) was 7 (50\%) of 14.


CONCLUSIONS

In this unrandomized trial, oral miltefosine was at least as effective as heroic doses of parenteral amphotericin B. The cure rate for miltefosine was approximately equivalent to historical cure rates using parenteral pentavalent antimony for mild and extensive disease in neighboring Peru. Although gastrointestinal side reactions do occur with miltefosine, its toxicity profile is superior to that of antimony and far superior to that of amphotericin B--in part because of the inherent attractiveness of oral versus parenteral agents. Our results suggest that miltefosine should be the treatment of choice for mucosal disease in North and South America.},

In this study, quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA) technology was used to detect and quantify Leishmania parasites in skin biopsy samples from CL patients. The assay is based on the detection of a small subunit rRNA (18S rRNA), which may allow for the detection of viable parasites. The QT-NASBA assay was evaluated using in vitro-cultured promastigotes and amastigotes and 2-mm skin biopsy samples from Old and New World CL patients. The study demonstrated that the lower detection limit of the QT-NASBA was two parasites per biopsy sample. Parasites could be quantified in a range of 2 to 11,300,000 parasites per biopsy sample. The QT-NASBA could detect levels of parasites 100-fold lower than those detected by conventional PCR. Test evaluation revealed that the QT-NASBA had a sensitivity of 97.5\% and a specificity of 100\% in the present study. The QT-NASBA is a highly sensitive and specific method that allows quantification of both Old and New World Leishmania parasites in skin biopsy samples and may provide an important tool for diagnosis as well as for monitoring the therapy of CL patients.},

Early guidelines on the dosage of pentamidine were based on the base-moiety of the two different formulations available. Confusion on the dosage of pentamidine arose from a different labelling of the two available products, either based on the salt or base moiety available in the preparation. We provide an overview of the various guidelines concerning HAT and leishmaniasis over the past decades and show the confusion in the calculation of the dosage of pentamidine in these guidelines and the subsequent published reports on clinical trials and reviews. At present, only pentamidine isethionate is available, but the advised dosage for HAT and leishmaniasis is (historically) based on the amount of pentamidine base. In the treatment of leishmaniasis this is probably resulting in a subtherapeutic treatment. There is thus a need for a new, more transparent and concise guideline concerning the dosage of pentamidine, at least in the treatment of HAT and leishmaniasis.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Limited available data suggest that older patients are more prone to develop paclitaxel-induced toxicity than their younger peers. It remains unclear whether this is related to age-dependent pharmacokinetics (PK) of paclitaxel. Primary objective of this study was to determine the influence of older age on the PK of paclitaxel.
METHODS: PK data of patients aged ≥70 years who received paclitaxel intravenously at the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) and the Radboud University Medical Center between September 2012 and May 2017 were collected. These prospectively collected data were pooled with previously published databases from multiple clinical trials conducted at the NKI and Erasmus MC Cancer Institute. A previously developed 3-compartment population PK model with saturable distribution and elimination was used to describe paclitaxel plasma concentration-time data. Hereafter, influence of age on paclitaxel PK was assessed in a previously established full covariate model.
RESULTS: In total, paclitaxel PK data from 684 patients were available, consisting of 166 patients ≥70 years (24\%). Median age of the cohort was 61 years (range 18 to 84 years). The impact of age, either treated as a continuous or dichotomous covariate ({\textless}70 versus ≥70 years), on the elimination of paclitaxel was only marginal but statistically significant (both p {\textless} 0.001 with no clinically relevant decrease in interindividual variability). For a typical patient, maximal elimination capacity decreased by only 5\% for a 10-year increment of age.
CONCLUSION: In this extensive multi-center dataset, which included a considerable number of older patients, older age had no clinically relevant impact on paclitaxel PK.},

Case studies from EPA and Health Canada risk values illustrate the use of data in chemical specific risk assessments to support the selection of uncertainty factors other than the default value of 10-fold. In the case studies, the types of data that have been used to support a change in the default value are explicitly reviewed, as well as why the data support a different uncertainty factor, how the uncertainty was reduced, and what assumptions have been satisfied or replaced. Incorporation of all available scientific data into the risk assessment process fosters increased research and ultimately reduces uncertainty.

Using a functional cloning approach, we have isolated a gene from Leishmania infantum that, upon over-expression, confers protection not only against miltefosine, but also against Sb(III), the active principle of anti-leishmanial antimonials. The gene encodes a very large putative polypeptide of 299kDa that shows no similarities to known proteins or functional motifs. Database mining and karyotyping experiments suggest that in L. infantum this gene is part of a 44-kbp duplicated region that is found on two separate chromosomes, CHR08 and CHR29.},

Since clinical features of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) mimic several other common diseases, accurate diagnosis is crucial as the treatment is associated with significant toxicity. Invasive and risky techniques involving demonstration of the parasites in stained preparations from splenic and bone marrow aspirate is still the gold standard for VL diagnosis. Serological tests using rK39 in ELISA or rapid immunochromatographic format, Direct Agglutination Test (DAT), immunoblotting have issues related to a significant proportion of asymptomatic individuals being positive with these tests and their inability to diagnose relapses as these remain positive for several months to years after cure. PCR is the most common molecular technique successfully used for diagnosis and differentiation of species. Through this review we focus extensively on the comparative utilities of the various diagnostic tools currently available for VL, describing in depth their advantages and disadvantages, addressing the recent advances attained in the field.

We reviewed the evidence and potential for combination therapy, and the criteria for the choice of drugs in such regimens. The first phase 2 results of combination regimens are promising, and have identified effective and safe regimens as short as 8 days. Several phase 3 trials are underway or planned in the Indian subcontinent and east Africa. The limited data available suggest that combination therapy is more cost-effective and reduces indirect costs for patients. Additional advantages are reduced treatment duration (8-17 days), with potentially better patient compliance and lesser burden on the health system. Only limited data are available on how best to prevent acquired resistance. Patients who are coinfected with visceral leishmaniasis and HIV could be a reservoir for development and spread of drug-resistant strains, calling for special precautions. The identification of a short, cheap, well-tolerated combination regimen that can be given in ambulatory care and needs minimal clinical monitoring will most likely have important public health implications. Effective monitoring systems and close regulations and policy will be needed to ensure effective implementation.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent reports indicated high miltefosine treatment failure rates for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) on the Indian subcontinent. To further explore the pharmacological factors associated with these treatment failures, a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study was performed to examine the relationship between miltefosine drug exposure and treatment failure in a cohort of Nepalese patients with VL.
METHODS: Miltefosine steady-state blood concentrations at the end of treatment were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling and a logistic regression model. Individual estimates of miltefosine exposure were explored for their relationship with treatment failure.
RESULTS: The overall probability of treatment failure was 21\%. The time that the blood concentration was {\textgreater}10 times the half maximal effective concentration of miltefosine (median, 30.2 days) was significantly associated with treatment failure: each 1-day decrease in miltefosine exposure was associated with a 1.08-fold (95\% confidence interval, 1.01-1.17) increased odds of treatment failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Achieving a sufficient exposure to miltefosine is a significant and critical factor for VL treatment success, suggesting an urgent need to evaluate the recently proposed optimal allometric miltefosine dosing regimen. This study establishes the first evidence for a drug exposure-effect relationship for miltefosine in the treatment of VL.},

	abstract = {Treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is marked by the failure of pentavalent antimonials which has brought amphotericin B (AmpB) to the forefront. In this study we have focused on signaling pathway regulating AmpB triggered effector response.
AmpB triggered effector response in the form of free radicals and proinflammatory cytokines was determined by FACS, colorimetric estimation or Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR). Specific peptide inhibitors for classical and atypical protein kinase C (PKC) were used to investigate the role of PKC isoforms in the functioning of AmpB during VL.
In vitro studies with THP1 cells showed that 2 μg/ml dose of AmpB could mediate effective parasite clearance due to strong induction of free radicals and proinflammatory cytokines. This induction of proinflammatory response paralleled with antagonistic regulation of classical and atypical PKC. Further confirmation was provided by RT-PCR of (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) PBMC isolated from VL infected patients undergoing AmpB treatment.
Overall, our results suggest that classical and atypical PKC signaling pathways are involved in the modulation of proinflammatory response triggered by AmpB against Leishmania donovani. These observations may contribute to the understanding of the mechanism responsible for the initiation of protective response induced by AmpB during VL.},

The risk of resistance is high in areas of anthroponotic visceral leishmaniasis, for example North Bihar, India, where the rate in some areas is 60\%. Post-epidemic Sudan is also at risk. Zoonotic areas in which HIV co-infection is common could also be at risk as sandflies can become infected from co-infected individuals. Many factors determine the choice of drug for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis, and drug resistance may not be the over-riding priority. In anthroponotic areas reduction in transmission through public health measures will be important, but the use of two drugs in combination should be seriously considered. Pharmacokinetic and other features of the drugs available, relevant to their use in combination are discussed and tentative suggestions made concerning trials of possible combinations. These include miltefosine plus paromomycin and allopurinol plus an azole. Lessons may be learnt from the experiences of similar problems in malaria, leprosy and tuberculosis. Guidelines are offered for the introduction of policies to use drugs in combination, which differ between anthroponotic and zoonotic areas of transmission.},

	abstract = {Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar, is a vector-borne disease caused by a protozoan of the Leishmania donovani complex. A phlebotomine sandfly transmits the parasite from person to person or via an animal reservoir. VL is a severe, debilitating disease, characterized by prolonged fever, splenomegaly, hypergammaglobulinaemia and pancytopenia. Patients become gradually ill over a period of a few months, and nearly always die if untreated. Case-fatality ratios are high even in treated patients. Worldwide an estimated 500,000 VL cases occur each year. This study reviews clinical, epidemiological and public health aspects of the disease and shows how critical adequate case detection is for the success of VL control. Examination of the issue of VL diagnosis with respect to the global challenges in VL control leads to the observation that a sound diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm for the health services in endemic areas is badly needed. Serological tests could be an alternative to parasitological diagnosis and the direct agglutination test (DAT) was found to fulfil many criteria for a 'field test', including cost effectiveness. Although research needs on vaccine and better drugs continue to be high on the agenda, a VL test-treatment strategy based on currently available highly sensitive serological tests, such as the DAT, should be introduced in the health services in endemic areas.},

It is therefore responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in a number of countries. Infections with E. histolytica are treated with nitroimidazoles, primarily with metronidazole. At this time, there is a lack of useful alternative classes of substances for the treatment of invasive amoebiasis. Alkylphosphocholines (alkyl-PCs) such as hexadecyl-PC (miltefosine) were originally developed as antitumor agents, but recently they have been successfully used for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in humans. We examined hexadecyl-PC and several other alkyl-PCs with longer alkyl chains, with and without double bond(s), for their activity against two strains of E. histolytica. The compounds with the highest activity were oleyl-PC, octadecyl-PC, and nonadecenyl-PC, with 50\% effective concentrations for 48 h of treatment between 15 and 21 microM for strain SFL-3 and between 73 and 98 microM for strain HM-1:IMSS. We also tested liposomal formulations of these alkyl-PCs and miltefosine. The alkyl-PC liposomes showed slightly lower activity, but are expected to be well tolerated. Liposomal formulations of oleyl-PC or closely related alkyl-PCs could be promising candidates for testing as broad-spectrum antiprotozoal and antitumor agents in humans.},

Clearance in the paediatric population should be investigated using models that describe size, maturation and organ function influences. Size is the primary covariate and although lean body weight is argued as a better measure than total body weight, the use of different fractions of fat mass to explain how pharmacokinetic parameters vary with body composition has been proposed. Allometric scaling using an empiric power exponent of 3/4 is superior to scaling using body surface area. The sigmoid hyperbolic model has proven useful to describe maturation. An extra parameter that describes asymmetry can be incorporated into this model. These descriptors are used to illustrate creatinine, morphine and paracetamol clearance in children. Simultaneous investigation of pooled GFR, paracetamol and morphine data enabled testing for shared common features of maturation processes. Results suggest that GFR matures before paracetamol or morphine clearance, consistent with phase II conjugation processes that convert xenobiotics to water soluble forms that can subsequently be eliminated from the body through the renal system. The use of such mechanistic approaches improves understanding of paediatric pharmacokinetics; improving dosing predictions and allowing projection in exploratory drug development.},

We have developed a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using leishmanial membrane antigenic extracts (LAg) to detect specific antibody responses in 25 untreated Indian visceral leishmaniasis patients. To investigate the pathogenetic significance of isotype markers in kala-azar, relative levels of specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, IgA, IgE, and IgG subclasses were analyzed under clinically established diseased conditions. Since LAg showed higher sensitivity for specific IgG than lysate, the immunoglobulin isotype responses were evaluated, with LAg as antigen. Compared to 60 controls, which included patients with malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, and typhoid and healthy subjects, visceral leishmaniasis patients showed significantly higher IgG (100\% sensitivity, 85\% specificity), IgM (48\% sensitivity, 100\% specificity), and IgE (44\% sensitivity, 98.3\% specificity) responses. Low levels of IgA in visceral leishmaniasis patients contrasted with a 13-fold-higher reactivity in sera from patients with leprosy. Among IgG subclasses, IgG1, -3, and -4 responses were significantly higher in visceral leishmaniasis patients than in the controls. IgG2 response, however, was significantly higher (twofold) in leprosy than even visceral leishmaniasis patients. The rank orders for sensitivity (IgG = IgG1 = IgG3 = IgG4 {\textgreater} IgG2 {\textgreater} IgM {\textgreater} IgE {\textgreater} IgA) and specificity (IgM = IgG3 {\textgreater} IgE {\textgreater} IgG4 {\textgreater} IgG2 {\textgreater} IgG {\textgreater} IgG1 {\textgreater} IgA) for LAg-specific antibody responses suggest the potentiality of IgG3 as a diagnostic marker for visceral leishmaniasis.},

These two antigens have predicted molecular weights of approximately 9 and 26 kDa and detect antibodies in sera of patients with kala-azar (k). Thus, to maintain consistency with nomenclature of the previously described 39 kDa diagnostic antigen of L. chagasi (k39 [1]), these antigens are being referred to as k9 and k26. A significant difference between k9 and k26 is the presence of 11 copies of a 14 amino acid repeat in the open reading frame of k26. The region flanking the repeats of k26 shares a 69\% identity with the open reading frame of k9. The recombinant proteins encoded by both antigens are very hydrophilic and show aberrant migration on SDS PAGE. Results of Southern blot analysis reveal that k9 and k26 are conserved to varying degrees among various Leishmania species. Interestingly, the repeat region of k26 is specific to L. chagasi and L. donovani while the flanking region is conserved among several other species. Transcript levels of k26 are significantly upregulated in the amastigote stage of the parasite. Our results show that recombinant K26 is specific in detecting antibodies in infection sera from visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients. Thus rK26 may complement rK39 in a more accurate diagnosis of VL in the old and the new world.},

Background: High levels of ventricular lactate, the brain spectroscopic signature of MELAS, correlate with more severe neurologic impairment. The authors hypothesized that chronic cerebral lactic acidosis exacerbates neuronal injury in MELAS and therefore, investigated DCA, a potent lactate-lowering agent, as potential treatment for MELAS. Methods: The authors conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 3-year cross-over trial of DCA (25 mg/kg/day) in 30 patients (aged 10 to 60 years) with MELAS and the A3243G mutation. Primary outcome measure was a Global Assessment of Treatment Efficacy (GATE) score based on a health-related event inventory, and on neurologic, neuropsychological, and daily living functioning. Biologic outcome measures included venous, CSF, and 1H MRSI-estimated brain lactate. Blood tests and nerve conduction studies were performed to monitor safety. Results: During the initial 24-month treatment period, 15 of 15 patients randomized to DCA were taken off study medication, compared to 4 of 15 patients randomized to placebo. Study medication was discontinued in 17 of 19 patients because of onset or worsening of peripheral neuropathy. The clinical trial was terminated early because of peripheral nerve toxicity. The mean GATE score was not significantly different between treatment arms. Conclusion: DCA at 25 mg/kg/day is associated with peripheral nerve toxicity resulting in a high rate of medication discontinuation and early study termination. Under these experimental conditions, the authors were unable to detect any beneficial effect. The findings show that DCA-associated neuropathy overshadows the assessment of any potential benefit in MELAS.},

In a cross over study design, six dogs per dose were utilized after a 1 week washout period. Plasma, microdialysate, and urine samples were collected upto 24 h and analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography. The average maximum concentration (C(max) ) of cefpodoxime in plasma was 13.66 (±6.30) and 27.14 (±4.56) μg/mL with elimination half-life (t(1/2) ) of 3.01 (±0.49) and 4.72 (±1.46) h following 5 and 10 mg/kg dose, respectively. The respective average area under the curve (AUC(0-∞) ) was 82.94 (±30.17) and 107.71 (±30.79) μg·h/mL. Cefpodoxime was readily distributed to skin and average free C(max) in subcutaneous fluid was 1.70 (±0.55) and 3.06 (±0.93) μg/mL at the two doses. Urinary excretion (unchanged cefpodoxime) was the major elimination route. Comparison of subcutaneous fluid concentrations using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic indices of fT({\textgreater}MIC) indicated that at 10 mg/kg dose; cefpodoxime would yield good therapeutic outcome in skin infections for bacteria with MIC(50) upto 0.5 μg/mL while higher doses (or more frequent dosing) may be needed for bacteria with higher MICs. High urine concentrations suggested cefpodoxime use for urinary infections in dogs.},

We have assessed the design and reporting of randomized, controlled trials evaluating treatments included in 2 Cochrane systematic reviews on cutaneous leishmaniasis. The analysis of the methodological quality identified some potential bias that can make it difficult to determine whether truly effective therapies exist for this disease. We found important weaknesses in the adequacy and transparency of randomization, loss of participants, causative Leishmania species, outcome measures, and follow-up times. Given these distorting effects on the evidence base, we propose guidelines for authors who wish to conduct clinical trials aimed at the development of effective therapies in cutaneous leishmaniasis. The recommendations in this report will hopefully deserve the attention of the World Health Organization and assist in the planning and prioritization of global strategies for improving the interpretation and replication of clinical research on cutaneous leishmaniasis.},

Human skin is characterized by a high autofluorescence. By introducing appropriate optical filters the autofluorescence of the skin was depressed and the penetration profile of fluorescence labelled vesicles was investigated. From optical sectioning it was obvious that neither the vesicles nor the fluorophore N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)diacylphosphatidylethanolamine (Rho-PE) penetrates in detectable amounts into the human skin. Differential scanning calorimetry of human stratum corneum revealed, that the peak positions of the human stratum corneum specific endothermic transitions at 10°C, 35°C, 50°C, 62°C, 73°C and 81°C did not change significantly after 18 h of non-occlusive vesicle application. However, the enthalpy of the transitions at 35°C, 50°C, 62°C and 73°C, estimated through peak heights increased, relative to the protein related peak at 81°C. A novel transition at 10°C was observed. From these data we conclude that DMPC liposomes do not penetrate intact into the human skin. We deduce, however, that the vesicles disintegrate at the surface of stratum corneum after non-occlusive application. The individual lipid molecules then interact with the lipid barrier of the stratum corneum and penetrate into the latter, which results in an increase of the enthalpy, related to the lipid components of the SC.},

The relationship between dose and effect of antileishmanial drugs in CL is unclear and a good quantitative descriptor of drug effect has not yet been established. This report describes the use of quantifying the parasite load in repeated full-thickness skin biopsies from lesions of two patients with extensive Old-World CL (Leishmania major and L. infantum) who both were treated with miltefosine to demonstrate the dynamics of parasite clearance within CL lesions. Therapeutic effect of miltefosine was already noticeable directly after start of treatment, with a rapid, log-linear decline in parasite load in the skin biopsies of approximately 1 log/week for the L. major infection. These observations illustrate the applicability of quantifying parasite loads as a pharmacodynamic measure for CL supporting clinical assessment. The methodology described here might enable better evaluation and comparison of standard and new therapeutics in future randomized clinical trials for CL.},

Antiretroviral treatment led to sustained suppression of HIV viremia but CD4+ lymphocytes rose from 8 to only 160 cells/mL. Several courses of antimony treatment did not prevent VL relapses. Renal failure developed in 2006 and renal biopsy revealed AA-amyloidosis. The patient had cryoglobulinemia and serum immune complexes containing antibodies directed against seven leishmanial antigens. Antimony plus amphotericin B, followed by oral miltefosine resulted in a sustained VL treatment response with elimination of circulating Leishmania infantum DNA and CD4+ recovery. The concomitant reduction of serum AA levels and disappearance of circulating leishmanial immune complexes suggests that prolonged VL may lead to AA-amyloidosis in immunocompromised humans.},

At a constant pressure of 25 mN/m, the adsorption kinetics of HePC into the monolayers showed that HePC molecules are inserted into the monolayer of lipids as monomers until the critical micellar concentration (CMC). At HePC concentrations superior to the CMC, the micelles of HePC are deployed at the interface as groups of monomers into the POPC or sterol monolayer. The study of mixture of HePC/(POPC or sterol), spread at the air-water interface, shows that a simple miscibility between HePC and POPC is observed, whereas a high condensation appears between HePC and sterols showing a high affinity between HePC and sterols. In addition, HePC does not act as detergent disturbing membrane integrity.},

In view of the prolonged treatment regimens necessary for PKDL, noncompliance is a major limitation; an optimal regimen is yet to be defined, but 12 weeks of therapy with miltefosine is generally recommended. We performed a single-arm open-label trial of miltefosine administered daily for 16 weeks in 27 patients in Kolkata with PKDL. After 4 weeks of treatment, nine patients were lost to follow-up because of unacceptable side effects, including severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Of the 18 remaining patients, seven completed 12 weeks of therapy and 11 completed 16 weeks of therapy. Three of the seven who received 12 weeks of therapy and none of the 11 who received 16 weeks of therapy experienced disease relapse. Our results suggest that a 16-week course of miltefosine is required for reliable cure of PKDL. Further, the study highlighted the urgent need for a multicentric randomized controlled trial of 12 versus 16 weeks of treatment with miltefosine for PKDL so as to achieve the goal of elimination of leishmaniasis in south Asia.},

Moreover, a simple, rapid and inexpensive colorimetric test was developed and evaluated for the detection of miltefosine in pharmaceutical products that can be used in the field. The complementary analytical techniques presented here were able to determine qualitatively or (semi-)quantitatively the presence or absence of miltefosine in pharmaceutical preparations and could identify suspected counterfeit miltefosine capsules.

All patients had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result before therapy, except 1, for whom no histopathologic material was available. The causative agent was identified as belonging to the Leishmania (Viannia) subgenus by hybridization. Despite clinical healing and absence of reactivation or development of mucosal lesions, PCR was positive in scars of 16 patients (80\%). The results suggest that parasites persist in the skin for many years despite treatment. Depending on specific pathogenetic features of the parasite and the immune status of the host, this phenomenon might result in mucosal lesions.

The objective of this study was to provide a rational approach to suggest durations of contraceptive cover for various miltefosine regimens.
METHODS: A human reproductive safety threshold exposure limit was derived using animal-to-human dose conversion. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data for miltefosine in females are lacking; a previously developed population PK model and a comprehensive anthropometric dataset were used to simulate PK data for Indian female VL patients receiving miltefosine for 5, 7, 10 or 28 days. Probability of supra-threshold miltefosine exposure was used to evaluate adequate durations of post-treatment contraceptive cover for the various regimens.
RESULTS: PK data were simulated for 465 treated Indian female VL patients of child-bearing potential with a median age of 25 years (IQR 16-31 years) and median weight of 38 kg (IQR 34-42 kg). From animal reproductive toxicity studies, a human reproductive safety threshold exposure limit was derived of 24.5 μg · day/mL. Probability of 'unprotected' supra-threshold miltefosine exposure was very low ({\textless}0.2\%) for a post-treatment contraceptive cover period of 4 months for the standard 28 day regimen, and of 2 months for the shorter regimens.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study providing rational suggestions for contraceptive cover for a teratogenic drug based on animal-to-human dose conversion. For the 28 day miltefosine regimen, post-treatment contraceptive cover may be extended to 4 months, whereas for all shorter regimens 2 months may be adequate.},

	abstract = {Neopterin, a compound derived from GTP, represents a precursor molecule of biopterin that is an essential cofactor in neurotransmitter synthesis. We have recently reported that in vivo as well as in vitro immune responses are accompanied by an increased release of neopterin and that this phenomenon can be used for the biochemical monitoring of diseases accompanied by hyperimmune stimulation. This article deals with the cellular origin and the control of this immune response-associated neopterin release in vitro. Using highly purified or monoclonal cellular reagents we demonstrate that macrophages (M phi) stimulated with supernatants from activated T cells release large amounts of neopterin into culture supernatants. Further experiments involving induction of neopterin release from M phi with various human recombinant interferons (IFNs) or neutralization of the effect of T cell supernatants with various monoclonal anti-IFN antibodies revealed immune IFN as the active principle. It thus appears that a metabolic pathway so far exclusively known in context with the generation of an essential cofactor of neurotransmitter-synthesis during immune responses is also activated in M phi under stringent control by immune IFN-like lymphokines.},

The iatrogenic pandemic of untreated illness related to falsified and substandard medicines is intolerable, but has a logical explanation: in many countries, inadequate laws make it barely illegal to manufacture or distribute poor-quality medicines. The law hardly punishes those who intentionally or recklessly deal in falsified or substandard medicine, when clearly it should criminalize these perpetrators in proportion to the grievous—even fatal—injury they inflict on public health. To solve this omission, this article presents a new Model Law on Medicine Crime, which countries may freely use as a template for strengthening their national laws. The Model Law includes criminal prohibitions against manufacturing, trafficking, or selling poor-quality medicines; principles for appropriately punishing offenders; special provisions for Internet-based medicine crimes; tools for encouraging whistle-blowers to cooperate with law enforcement; incentives for developing governments to strengthen their drug regulatory capacity; and important exceptions to prevent the law being abused, such as to prevent the prosecution of legitimate medical researchers or to prevent good-quality generic medicines being seized while in transit. The Model Law is discussed and explained and is offered free of charge under a Creative Commons license to any governments wanting to implement it.},

OBJECTIVES: To study the transport and accumulation of saquinavir (SQV) in PBMC and the effects of specific inhibitors of MRP1, MRP2, P-gp and BCRP. METHODS: Transport and accumulation of [H]-SQV was measured in PBMC in the absence or presence of specific and non-specific inhibitors of MRP1, MRP2, P-gp and BCRP. Flow cytometric, western blot and real-time PCR assays were used to examine the relative expression of the drug efflux transporters in the same batches of PBMC. RESULTS: MRP2 is present in PBMC. The expression of P-gp, MRP1, MRP2 (mRNA) and BCRP all displayed batch-to-batch variability. Specific and non-specific inhibitors of MRP1, P-gp and MRP2 significantly increased the baseline accumulation of SQV. Accumulation of SQV was not correlated with the expression of any single transporter. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple drug efflux transporters are important in the intracellular accumulation of SQV in PBMC. If drug efflux contributes towards virological failure, then all contributing transporters will need to be inhibited.},

The characteristics of HePC incorporation into the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 were investigated in order to understand its oral absorption mechanism. The results provide evidence for the involvement of a carrier-mediated mechanism, since the association of HePC at the apical pole of Caco-2 cells was (1) saturable as a function of time with a rapid initial incorporation over 5 min followed by a more gradual increase; (2) saturable as a function of concentration over the range studied (2-200 microM) with a saturable component which followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (apparent K (m) 15.7 micromol/L, V (max) 39.2 nmol/mg protein/h) and a nonspecific diffusion component; (3) partially inhibited by low temperature and ATP depletion, indicating the temperature and energy-dependence of the uptake process. Moreover, we demonstrated, by an albumin back-extraction method, that HePC is internalized via translocation from the outer to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and that HePC may preferentially diffuse through intact raft microdomains. In conclusion, our results suggest that incorporation of HePC at the apical membrane of Caco-2 cells may occur through a passive diffusion followed by a translocation in the inner membrane leaflet through an active carrier-mediated mechanism.},

Given the paucity of anti-VL drugs and the looming threat of resistance, there is an obvious need for close monitoring of clinical efficacy of MIL.
METHODS: In a cohort study of 120 VL patients treated with MIL in Nepal, we monitored the clinical outcomes up to 12 months after completion of therapy and explored the potential role of drug compliance, parasite drug resistance, and reinfection.
RESULTS: The initial cure rate was 95.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 92.2-99.4) and the relapse rate at 6 and 12 months was 10.8\% (95\% CI, 5.2-16.4) and 20.0\% (95\% CI, 12.8-27.2) , respectively. No significant clinical risk factors of relapse apart from age {\textless}12 years were found. Parasite fingerprints of pretreatment and relapse bone marrow isolates within 8 patients were similar, suggesting that clinical relapses were not due to reinfection with a new strain. The mean promastigote MIL susceptibility (50\% inhibitory concentration) of isolates from definite cures was similar to that of relapses. Although more tolerant strains were observed, parasite resistance, as currently measured, is thus not likely involved in MIL treatment failure. Moreover, MIL blood levels at the end of treatment were similar in cured and relapsed patients. Conclusions: Relapse in one-fifth of the MIL-treated patients observed in our study is an alarming signal for the VL elimination campaign, urging for further review and cohort monitoring.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Model evaluation is an important issue in population analyses. We aimed to perform a systematic review of all population PK and/or PD analyses published between 2002 and 2004 to survey the current methods used to evaluate a model and to assess whether those models were adequately evaluated.

Methods
We selected 324 papers in MEDLINE using defined keywords and built a data abstraction form (DAF) composed of a checklist of items to extract the relevant information from these articles with respect to model evaluation. In the DAF, evaluation methods were divided into 3 subsections: basic internal methods (goodness-of-fit plots [GOF], uncertainty in parameter estimates and model sensitivity), advanced internal methods (data splitting, resampling techniques and Monte Carlo simulations) and external model evaluation.

Results
Basic internal evaluation was the most frequently described method in the reports: 65\% of the models involved GOF evaluation. Standard errors or confidence intervals were reported for 50\% of fixed effects but only 22\% of random effects. Advanced internal methods were used in approximately 25\% of models: data splitting was more often used than bootstrap and cross-validation; simulations were used in 6\% of models to evaluate models by visual predictive check or by posterior predictive check. External evaluation was performed in only 7\% of models.

Conclusions
Using the subjective synthesis of model evaluation for each paper, we judged models to be adequately evaluated in 28\% of PK models and 26\% of PD models. Basic internal evaluation was preferred to more advanced methods, probably because the former are performed easily with most software. We also noticed that when the aim of modelling was predictive, advanced internal methods or more stringent methods were more often used.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \&\#38; OBJECTIVES

Sodium antimony gluconate (SAG) is reported to be losing its efficacy in Bihar as a first line drug for treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Concerned with the increasing incidence of antimony-resistant VL patients in Bihar, we undertook an epidemiological, clinical and pharmacological study to formulate a scientific basis for choosing a suitable first line drug for VL.


METHODS

Consecutive, fresh and parasitologically confirmed patients of VL from different geographical areas of Bihar were considered for inclusion in the study. Parasites isolated from patients were tested in vitro to assess their response to sodium antimony gluconate (SAG) to 20 microg/ml, response to 20 mg/kg of SAG for 5 days in experimentally induced VL in BALB/c mice from those isolates, and response to SAG in patients treated with SAG for 28 days. Similarly response in culture (1 microg/ml) to amphotericin B (AMB) of all 282 isolates, (1 mg/kg body wt for 20 days) in patients and infected BALB/c mice (1 mg/kg body wt for 5 days) was determined. Antimony levels of plasma were determined at 2, 8 and 24 h after intramuscular injection of SAG. Patients unwilling for SAG treatment or relapsed after SAG treatment and withdrawn from SAG group because of toxicity were treated with AMB. Plasma antimony levels were estimated by atomic absorption spectrometer.


RESULTS

Though antimony sensitive and resistant patient were distributed in all 14 districts of Bihar studied, there was a significant variation from district to district. Of the 123 patients included in the SAG treatment group, 19 were withdrawn due to development of toxicity and 2 died; 178 patients were treated with AMB. No patient in AMB group developed any toxicity or died. Only 47 (46\%) of 102 patients, 106 (37.6\%) of 282 infected macrophages, 90 (52.9\%) of 170 experimental infections were cured with SAG. Mc Nemar's test on paired comparisons showed statistical significance difference (P{\textless}0.01) between infected macrophage and experimental infection. AMB cured all patients, infected mice and cleared parasites from all isolates.


INTERPRETATION \&\#38; CONCLUSION

Antimony resistant strains of L. donovani were wide spread over different geographical areas in Bihar. SAG cured lesser percentage of VL cases clinically compared to AMB and should be replaced by AMB as a first line drug.},

Miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine, Impavido™), a novel antiprotozoal drug used for the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, was identified and evaluated independently in the early 1980s as a potential anticancer drug in Germany and as an antileishmanial drug in the UK. Although miltefosine is not the most active compound of its class against Leishmania parasites in vitro, the early demonstration of activity after oral administration in experimental models of visceral leishmaniasis helped to bring this compound to the attention of WHO TDR for further development in a unique collaboration model with the pharmaceutical industry (Zentaris GmbH). Miltefosine is active against most Leishmania species, including those that cause cutaneous disease.},

The most prominent is the phagocyte-derived chitotriosidase, the plasma levels of which are markedly elevated in some pathological conditions.

The enzyme is located in specific granules of human PMNs and secreted following stimulation with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In addition, GM-CSF induces expression of chitotriosidase in m that constitutively secrete the enzyme and partly accumulate it in their lysosomes. Studies with recombinant human chitotriosidase revealed that the enzyme targets chitin-containing fungi. These findings are consistent with earlier observations concerning anti-fungal activity of homologous plant chitinases and beneficial effects of GM-CSF administration in individuals suffering from invasive fungal infections. In conclusion, chitotriosidase should be viewed as a component of the innate immunity that may play a role in defence against chitin-containing pathogens and the expression and release of which by human phagocytes is highly regulated.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H(2) receptor antagonists (H(2)RAs) have become the mainstay of therapy in acid-related upper gastrointestinal disorders. There have been concerns raised about the possible association of PPIs with enteric infections.


OBJECTIVE

We conducted a systematic review to evaluate any association between acid suppression and enteric infection. We also assessed differences between types of enteric infections and the type of acid suppression.


DATA SOURCES

Electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966-2005), EMBASE (1988-2005), and CINAHL (1982-2005) were undertaken using a combination of subject headings and text words related to PPI therapy, H(2)RAs, and enteric infections.


STUDY SELECTION

All observational studies were eligible, including cross-sectional, case control, and cohort studies that evaluated risk of enteric infection associated with antisecretory therapy. Eligibility assessment was made by two independent researchers.


DATA EXTRACTION

Information on study design, patient population, type of acid suppression, type of infection, and outcomes was collected. The odds ratio (OR) of taking acid suppression therapy in cases and controls was calculated and results were synthesized using a random effects model (DerSimonian and Laird, Stats direct version 2.4.4).


DATA SYNTHESIS

A total of 12 papers evaluating 2,948 patients with Clostridium difficile were included in the review. There was an increased risk of taking antisecretory therapy in those infected with C. difficile (pooled OR 1.94, 95\% CI 1.37-2.75). There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (P= 0.0006) that was not explained by planned subgroup analysis. The association was greater for PPI use (OR 1.96, 95\% CI 1.28-3.00) compared with H(2)RA use (OR 1.40, 95\% CI 0.85-2.29). A total of six studies evaluated Salmonella, Campylobacter, and other enteric infections in 11,280 patients. There was an increased risk of taking acid suppression in those with enteric infections (OR 2.55, 95\% CI 1.53-4.26). There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (P {\textless} 0.0001) that was not explained by subgroup analysis. The association was greater for PPI use (OR 3.33, 95\% CI 1.84-6.02) compared with H(2)RA use (OR 2.03, 95\% CI 1.05-3.92).


CONCLUSION

There is an association between acid suppression and an increased risk of enteric infection. Further prospective studies on patients taking long-term acid suppression are needed to establish whether this association is causal.},

Currently, splenic aspirate smear and culture are the standard methods of monitoring therapy and relapse. Acute phase reactant markers, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A protein (SAA) and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) were evaluated as less invasive techniques for monitoring therapy in 59 patients with VL before, during and after therapy. CRP, SAA and AGP were elevated in VL patients at admission and the concentrations decreased with effective therapy to reach normal levels by the end of therapy (SAA and AGP) or by 3 months follow-up (CRP). Two groups of patients were selected on the basis of rate of parasite clearance. The acute phase protein concentrations were significantly raised in those slower to clear parasites. Analysis of sensitivity and specificity of acute phase proteins as predictors of parasite clearance suggested that they might represent useful non-invasive markers for monitoring disease activity, response to therapy and relapse in VL.},

	abstract = {Cefquinome is a cephalosporin with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, including activity against Staphylococcus aureus. The objective of our study was to examine the in vivo activity of cefquinome against S. aureus strains by using a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model. Cefquinome kinetics and protein binding in infected neutropenic mice were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In vivo postantibiotic effects (PAEs) were determined after a dose of 100 mg/kg of body weight in mice infected with S. aureus strain ATCC 29213. The animals were treated by subcutaneous injection of cefquinome at doses of 2.5 to 320 mg/kg of body weight per day divided into 1, 2, 3, 6, or 12 doses over 24 h. Cefquinome exhibited time-dependent killing and produced in vivo PAEs at 2.9 h. The percentage of time that serum concentrations were above the MIC (\%T{\textgreater}MIC) was the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) index that best described the efficacy of cefquinome. Subsequently, we employed a similar dosing strategy by using increasing total cefquinome doses that increased 4-fold and were administered every 4 h to treat animals infected with six additional S. aureus isolates. A sigmoid maximum effect (Emax) model was used to estimate the magnitudes of the ratios of the \%T that the free-drug serum concentration exceeded the MIC (\%T{\textgreater}fMIC) associated with net bacterial stasis, a 0.5-log10 CFU reduction from baseline, and a 1-log10 CFU reduction from baseline; the respective values were 30.28 to 36.84\%, 34.38 to 46.70\%, and 43.50 to 54.01\%. The clear PAEs and potent bactericidal activity make cefquinome an attractive option for the treatment of infections caused by S. aureus.},

Here, we show that the miltefosine transporter (LdMT), a member of the P4-ATPase subfamily in Leishmania donovani, and the Cdc50-like protein LdRos3 form a stable complex that plays an essential role in maintaining phospholipid asymmetry in the parasite plasma membrane. Loss of either LdMT or LdRos3 abolishes ATP-dependent transport of NBD-labelled phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine from the outer to the inner plasma membrane leaflet and results in an increased cell surface exposure of endogenous PE. We also find that promastigotes of L. donovani lack any detectable amount of phosphatidylserine (PS) but retain their infectivity in THP-1-derived macrophages. Likewise, infectivity was unchanged for parasites without LdMT-LdRos3 complexes. We conclude that exposure of PS and PE to the exoplasmic leaflet is not crucial for the infectivity of L. donovani promastigotes.},

Effect of quercetin on disposition of enrofloxacin was investigated and Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic indices were calculated. Enrofloxacin was absorbed after oral administration in infected animals but with large inter-individual variations. Low concentrations of its main metabolite, ciprofloxacin, were found which could be explained with marked reduction of enrofloxacin transformation in infected animals. Quercetin significantly decreased bioavailability of enrofloxacin and its transformation to ciprofloxacin. Lower formation of metabolite was also found in the studied tissues as spleen, heart, lungs and in liver of group treated in combination with quercetin. Results in infected and quercetin (50 mg/kg) treated group shows lower percentage of re-isolates of the pathogen bacteria in comparison to infected and untreated animals, and close to the low dose (10 mg/kg) of enrofloxacin. High dose of enrofloxacin given in a short time in an infection model with high inoculum size, resulted in better eradication of bacteria although re-isolates could be found in spleen.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Miltefosine (MIL), the only oral drug for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), is currently the first-line therapy in the VL elimination program of the Indian subcontinent. Given the paucity of anti-VL drugs and the looming threat of resistance, there is an obvious need for close monitoring of clinical efficacy of MIL.
METHODS: In a cohort study of 120 VL patients treated with MIL in Nepal, we monitored the clinical outcomes up to 12 months after completion of therapy and explored the potential role of drug compliance, parasite drug resistance, and reinfection.
RESULTS: The initial cure rate was 95.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 92.2-99.4) and the relapse rate at 6 and 12 months was 10.8\% (95\% CI, 5.2-16.4) and 20.0\% (95\% CI, 12.8-27.2) , respectively. No significant clinical risk factors of relapse apart from age {\textless}12 years were found. Parasite fingerprints of pretreatment and relapse bone marrow isolates within 8 patients were similar, suggesting that clinical relapses were not due to reinfection with a new strain. The mean promastigote MIL susceptibility (50\% inhibitory concentration) of isolates from definite cures was similar to that of relapses. Although more tolerant strains were observed, parasite resistance, as currently measured, is thus not likely involved in MIL treatment failure. Moreover, MIL blood levels at the end of treatment were similar in cured and relapsed patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Relapse in one-fifth of the MIL-treated patients observed in our study is an alarming signal for the VL elimination campaign, urging for further review and cohort monitoring.},

As pharmacokinetic (PK) data on cefpirome from studies of CF patients are lacking, we systematically compared its population PK and pharmacodynamic breakpoints for CF patients and healthy volunteers of similar body size. Twelve adult CF patients (median lean body mass [LBM] = 45.7 kg) and 12 healthy volunteers (LBM = 50.0 kg) received a single 10-min intravenous infusion of 2 g cefpirome. Plasma and urine concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Population PK and Monte Carlo simulations were performed using NONMEM and S-ADAPT and a duration of an unbound plasma concentration above the MIC ≥ 65\% of the dosing interval as a pharmacodynamic target. Unscaled clearances for CF patients were similar to those seen with healthy volunteers, and the volume of distribution was 6\% lower for CF patients. Linear scaling of total clearance by WT resulted in clearance that was 20\% higher (P ≤ 0.001 [nonparametric bootstrap]) in CF patients. Allometric scaling by LBM explained the differences between the two subject groups with respect to average clearance and volume of distribution and reduced the unexplained between-subject variability of renal and nonrenal clearance by 10 to 14\%. For the CF patients, robust ({\textgreater}90\%) probabilities of target attainment (PTA) were achieved by the administration of a standard dose of 2 g/70 kg WT every 12 h (Q12h) given as 30-min infusions for MICs ≤ 1.5 mg/liter. As alternative dosage regimens, a 5-h infusion of 1.33 g/70 kg WT Q8h achieved robust PTAs for MICs ≤ 8 to 12 mg/liter and a continuous infusion of 4 g/day for MICs ≤ 12 mg/liter.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Caspofungin is an echinocandin antifungal agent used as first-line therapy for the treatment of invasive candidiasis. The maintenance dose is adapted to body weight (BW) or liver function (Child-Pugh score B or C). We aimed to study the pharmacokinetics of caspofungin and assess pharmacokinetic target attainment for various dosing strategies.
METHODS: Caspofungin pharmacokinetic data from 21 intensive care unit (ICU) patients was available. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed. Various dosing regimens (loading dose/maintenance dose) were simulated: licensed regimens (I) 70/50 mg (for BW {\textless}80 kg) or 70/70 mg (for BW {\textgreater}80 kg); and (II) 70/35 mg (for Child-Pugh score B); and adapted regimens (III) 100/50 mg (for Child-Pugh score B); (IV) 100/70 mg; and (V) 100/100 mg. Target attainment based on a preclinical pharmacokinetic target for Candida albicans was assessed for relevant minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs).
RESULTS: A two-compartment model best fitted the data. Clearance was 0.55 L/h and the apparent volumes of distribution in the central and peripheral compartments were 8.9 and 5.0 L, respectively. The median area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 h on day 14 for regimens I-V were 105, 65, 93, 130, and 186 mg·h/L, respectively. Pharmacokinetic target attainment was 100 \% (MIC 0.03 µg/mL) irrespective of dosing regimen but decreased to (I) 47 \%, (II) 14 \%, (III) 36 \%, (IV) 69 \%, and (V) 94 \% for MIC 0.125 µg/mL.
CONCLUSION: The caspofungin maintenance dose should not be reduced in non-cirrhotic ICU patients based on the Child-Pugh score if this classification is driven by hypoalbuminemia as it results in significantly lower exposure. A higher maintenance dose of 70 mg in ICU patients results in target attainment of {\textgreater}90 \% of the ICU patients with species with an MIC of up to 0.125 µg/mL.},

To explore current patterns of diagnosis and treatment, quantify household economic impact and identify household strategies to cover the costs of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) care in rural Bangladesh.


METHOD

Structured interviews with 113 VL patients from 87 households documenting all provider visits and expenditures for health care for VL, and the ways in which the expenditures were covered.


RESULTS

Patients paid a median of 7 visits to six different providers before beginning VL treatment. All visited the subdistrict government hospital at least once. While health care, including antileishmanial drug therapy, is officially available free of charge at government facilities, 79\% of patients reported making informal payments for provider access, diagnostics and drug administration; only 14\% of patients received their full drug course from this source. For the 58\% of patients who purchased the full treatment course, drug cost constituted 34\% of direct expenditure. Median direct expenditure for one VL patient was US\$87 and median income lost was \$40; median total expenditure was 1.2 times annual per capita income of our study population. Households employed multiple coping strategies to cover expenditures, most commonly sale or rental of assets (62\%) and taking out loans (64\%).


CONCLUSIONS

Visceral leishmaniasis treatment causes a major economic burden in affected families. Control strategies for VL should facilitate timely, affordable diagnosis and treatment of patients to decrease the infection reservoir and to alleviate the economic burden of VL on households.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To facilitate the choice of the best visceral leishmaniasis (VL) treatment strategy for first-line health services in (VL)-endemic areas, we compared in a formal decision analysis the cost and the cost-effectiveness of the different available options.


METHODS

We selected four drug regimens for VL on the basis of frequency of use, feasibility and reported efficacy studies. The point estimates and the range of plausible values of effectiveness and cost were retrieved from a literature review. A decision tree was constructed and the strategy minimizing the cost per death averted was selected.


RESULTS

Treatment with amphotericin B deoxycholate was the most effective approach in the baseline analysis and averted 87.2\% of all deaths attributable to VL. The least expensive and the most cost-effective treatment was the miltefosine regimen, and the most expensive and the least cost-effective was AmBisome treatment. The cost of drug and medical care are the main determinants of the cost-effectiveness ranking of the alternative schemes. Sensitivity analysis showed that antimonial was competitive with miltefosine in the low-resistance regions.


CONCLUSION

In areas with {\textgreater}94\% response rates to antimonials, generic sodium stibogluconate remains the most cost-effective option for VL treatment, mainly due to low drug cost. In other regions, miltefosine is the most cost-effective option of treatment, but its use as a first-line drug is limited by its teratogenicity and rapid resistance development. AmBisome in mono- or combination therapy is too expensive to compete in cost-effectiveness with the other regimens.},

Development of high levels of resistance to various existing drugs necessitated the search for alternative orally administered drugs. Hospital-based studies have shown that oral miltefosine is a highly effective treatment for VL both in adults and in children. METHODS: An open, single-arm trial was designed to investigate the feasibility of treatment of VL patients with miltefosine in field conditions in 13 centers in Bihar. RESULTS: The phase 4 study was conducted among 1132 adult and pediatric VL patients. Compliance was good, with 1084 (95.5\%) patients completing the full 28-day treatment course. Nine hundred and seventy-one (85.8\%) patients returned for the final cure assessment at 6 months after treatment. The final cure rate was 82\% by intention to treat analysis and 95\% by per protocol analysis (similar to the 94\% cure rate in hospitalized patients). Treatment-related adverse events of common toxicity criteria grade 3 occurred in {\textasciitilde}3\% of patients, including gastrointestinal toxicity and rise in aspertate amino transferase, alanine amino transferase, or serum creatinine levels, similar to previous clinical experience.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

The clinical spectrum of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a chronic intracellular parasitic disease, ranges from a subclinical, asymptomatic infection to severe clinical disease (kala-azar). In experimental leishmaniasis, mice that have a Th1 response to infection tend to have limited disease while a Th2 response is associated with disease progression. Humans with VL most often have mixed rather than polarized responses. However, most clinical studies have used methods that require a relatively large sample volume, thus limiting their scope. Measuring multiple cytokine levels in blood samples using a multiplexed microsphere assay (MMA) may be useful to further evaluate the Th1/Th2 paradigm in humans.


METHODS

Bangladeshi individuals (n=120) living in an area endemic for VL were categorized into one of the five clinical categories. Sera from these individuals were measured for levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha by multiplexed microsphere cytokine immunoassay.


RESULTS

Circulating IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12 differed significantly among the clinical groups. Persons with kala-azar demonstrated the highest median levels of IL-8 and IL-10 but lower median levels of IL-12.


CONCLUSIONS

The MMA for cytokines is an extremely time-and sample-efficient method for characterizing circulating cytokine levels in visceral leishmaniasis patients.},

Resistance and susceptibility are correlated with distinct patterns of cytokine production in murine models of disseminated leishmanial disease. To assess lesional cytokine profiles in patients with kala-azar, bone marrow aspirates were analyzed using a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR technique to amplify specific mRNA sequences of multiple Th1-, Th2-, and/or macrophage-associated cytokines. Transcript levels of IL-10 as well as IFN-gamma were significantly elevated in patients with active visceral leishmaniasis; IL-10 levels decreased markedly with resolution of disease. These findings suggest that IL-10, a potent, pleiotropic suppressor of all known microbicidal effector functions of macrophages, may contribute to the pathogenesis of kala-azar by inhibiting the cytokine-mediated activation of host macrophages that is necessary for the control of leishmanial infection.},

Hence there is a need to explore alternative treatment protocols such as miltefosine alone or in combinations including miltefosine, sodium stibogluconate (SSG) or liposomal amphotericin B. The aim of this trial is to identify regimen(s) which are sufficiently promising for future trials in East Africa.
METHODS/DESIGN: A phase II randomized, parallel arm, open-labelled trial is being conducted to assess the efficacy of each of the three regimens: liposomal amphotericin B with SSG, Liposomal amphotericin B with miltefosine and miltefosine alone. The primary endpoint is cure at day 28 with secondary endpoint at day 210 (6 months). Initial cure is a single composite measure based on parasitologic evaluation (bone marrow, spleen or lymph node aspirate) and clinical assessment. Repeated interim analyses have been planned after recruitment of 15 patients in each arm with a maximum sample size of 63 for each. These will follow group-sequential methods (the triangular test) to identify when a regimen is inadequate ({\textless}75\% efficacy) or adequate ({\textgreater}90\% efficacy). We describe a method to ensure consistency of the sequential analysis of day 28 cure with the non-sequential analysis of day 210 cure.
DISCUSSION: A regimen with adequate efficacy would be a candidate for treatment of VL with reasonable costs. The design allows repeated testing throughout the trial recruitment period while maintaining good statistical properties (Type I \& II error rates) and reducing the expected sample sizes.

Reports of the clinical effectiveness of aminosidine sulphate, especially in combination with sodium stibogluconate, in visceral leishmaniasis and the finding that this antibiotic is potent against L. aethiopica in vitro, prompted us to evaluate its usefulness in DCL. Two patients with long-standing, active DCL were treated for 60 d with aminosidine sulphate, 14 mg/kg/d parenterally. The skin lesions resolved completely in both patients although they relapsed subsequently. Synergism between aminosidine and stibogluconate was demonstrated in vitro against parasites isolated from the patients. This led us to administer combined therapy, aminosidine sulphate 14 mg/kg/d and sodium stibogluconate 10 mg/kg/d, to the 2 patients in relapse and to another, third patient. Treatment was continued for 2 months beyond parasitological cure. Side effects were minimal. Following treatment, a return of specific cell-mediated immunity occurred, as expressed by a moderate infiltration of lymphocytes into the lesions and by lymphocyte proliferation in vitro in the presence of live Leishmania antigen, with synthesis of interleukin-2 and interferon gamma with one patient and interleukin 4 with the other. During follow-up periods of 2 to 21 months after treatment, no sign of relapse was seen.},

The subjects were segregated into four categories: 230 confirmed patients, 52 probable cases, 70 non-cases and 100 healthy endemic controls. The first two groups were used for estimating sensitivity, the latter two for specificity. Sensitivity of DAT-FD was 98.9\%, rK-39: 98.9\%, KAtex: 67.0\% and rK-26: 21.3\%. Sensitivity of DAT-FD on blood taken on filter paper (DAT-FDF) was 99.3\%, which was comparable with that using serum.

We have cloned a putative MIL transporter (LdMT) by functional rescue, using a Leishmania donovani-resistant line defective in the inward-directed translocation of both MIL and glycerophospholipids. LdMT is a novel P-type ATPase belonging to the partially characterized aminophospholipid translocase subfamily. Resistant parasites transfected with LdMT regain their sensitivity to MIL and edelfosine and the ability to normally take up [14C]MIL and fluorescent-labeled glycerophospholipids. Moreover, LdMT localizes to the plasma membrane, and its overexpression in Leishmania tarentolae, a species non-sensitive to MIL, significantly increases the uptake of [14C]MIL, strongly suggesting that this protein behaves as a true translocase. Finally, both LdMT-resistant alleles encompass single but distinct point mutations, each of which impairs transport function, explaining the resistant phenotype. These results demonstrate biochemically and genetically the direct involvement of LdMT in MIL and phospholipids translocation in Leishmania and describe for the first time a P-type ATPase involved in MIL uptake and potency in eukaryotic cells.},

	abstract = {Although vancomycin is often regarded as an agent that concentrates poorly in the lower respiratory tract, as determined from concentrations in epithelial lining fluid (ELF), few data are available. This study sought to determine the profile of vancomycin exposure in the ELF relative to plasma. Population modeling and Monte Carlo simulation were employed to estimate the penetration of vancomycin into ELF. Plasma and ELF pharmacokinetic (PK) data were obtained from 10 healthy volunteers. Concentration-time profiles in plasma and ELF were simultaneously modeled using a three-compartment model with zero-order infusion and first-order elimination and transfer using the big nonparametric adaptive grid (BigNPAG) program. Monte Carlo simulation with 9,999 subjects was performed to calculate the ELF/plasma penetration ratios by estimating the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in ELF (AUC(ELF)) and plasma (AUC(plasma)) after a single simulated 1,000-mg dose. The mean (standard deviation) AUC(ELF)/AUC(plasma) penetration ratio was 0.675 (0.677), and the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile penetration ratios were 0.265, 0.474, and 0.842, respectively. Our results indicate that vancomycin penetrates ELF at approximately 50\% of plasma levels. To properly judge the adequacy of current doses and schedules employed in practice, future studies are needed to delineate the PK/PD (pharmacodynamics) target for vancomycin in ELF. If the PK/PD target in ELF is found to be consistent with the currently proposed target of an AUC/MIC of ≥400, suboptimal probability of target attainment would be expected when vancomycin is utilized for pneumonias due to MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) with MICs in excess of 1 mg/liter.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Caspofungin is an echinocandin antifungal agent used as first-line therapy for the treatment of invasive candidiasis. The maintenance dose is adapted to body weight (BW) or liver function (Child-Pugh score B or C). We aimed to study the pharmacokinetics of caspofungin and assess pharmacokinetic target attainment for various dosing strategies.
METHODS: Caspofungin pharmacokinetic data from 21 intensive care unit (ICU) patients was available. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed. Various dosing regimens (loading dose/maintenance dose) were simulated: licensed regimens (I) 70/50 mg (for BW {\textless}80 kg) or 70/70 mg (for BW {\textgreater}80 kg); and (II) 70/35 mg (for Child-Pugh score B); and adapted regimens (III) 100/50 mg (for Child-Pugh score B); (IV) 100/70 mg; and (V) 100/100 mg. Target attainment based on a preclinical pharmacokinetic target for Candida albicans was assessed for relevant minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs).
RESULTS: A two-compartment model best fitted the data. Clearance was 0.55 L/h and the apparent volumes of distribution in the central and peripheral compartments were 8.9 and 5.0 L, respectively. The median area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 h on day 14 for regimens I-V were 105, 65, 93, 130, and 186 mg·h/L, respectively. Pharmacokinetic target attainment was 100 \% (MIC 0.03 µg/mL) irrespective of dosing regimen but decreased to (I) 47 \%, (II) 14 \%, (III) 36 \%, (IV) 69 \%, and (V) 94 \% for MIC 0.125 µg/mL.
CONCLUSION: The caspofungin maintenance dose should not be reduced in non-cirrhotic ICU patients based on the Child-Pugh score if this classification is driven by hypoalbuminemia as it results in significantly lower exposure. A higher maintenance dose of 70 mg in ICU patients results in target attainment of {\textgreater}90 \% of the ICU patients with species with an MIC of up to 0.125 µg/mL.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

There are 500,000 cases per year of visceral leishmaniasis, which occurs primarily in the Indian subcontinent. Almost all untreated patients die, and all the effective agents have been parenteral. Miltefosine is an oral agent that has been shown in small numbers of patients to have a favorable therapeutic index for Indian visceral leishmaniasis. We performed a clinical trial in India comparing miltefosine with the most effective standard treatment, amphotericin B.


METHODS

The study was a randomized, open-label comparison, in which 299 patients 12 years of age or older received orally administered miltefosine (50 or 100 mg [approximately 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight] daily for 28 days) and 99 patients received intravenously administered amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram every other day for a total of 15 injections).


RESULTS

The groups were well matched in terms of age, weight, proportion with previous failure of treatment for leishmaniasis, parasitologic grade of splenic aspirate, and splenomegaly. At the end of treatment, splenic aspirates were obtained from 293 patients in the miltefosine group and 98 patients in the amphotericin B group. No parasites were identified, for an initial cure rate of 100 percent. By six months after the completion of treatment, 282 of the 299 patients in the miltefosine group (94 percent [95 percent confidence interval, 91 to 97]) and 96 of the 99 patients in the amphotericin B group (97 percent) had not had a relapse; these patients were classified as cured. Vomiting and diarrhea, generally lasting one to two days, occurred in 38 percent and 20 percent of the patients in the miltefosine group, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS

Oral miltefosine is an effective and safe treatment for Indian visceral leishmaniasis. Miltefosine may be particularly advantageous because it can be administered orally. It may also be helpful in regions where parasites are resistant to current agents.},

The animals in Group 1 were administered an oral solution of 2\% of miltefosine at 2 mg/kg b.w. once a day, for twenty-eight days. The animals in Group 2 were administered a preparation of meglumine antimoniate at 100 mg/kg b.w. subcutaneously once a day for twenty-eight days. After treatment, all dogs were followed-up for a further twenty-eight days. Dogs were observed daily and clinically examined ten times throughout the study. On days -1 and 55 a renal biopsy was performed on all dogs and analyzed by light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. All the examinations failed to demonstrate any lesions in the miltefosine-treated dogs. Conversely, all the meglumine antimoniate-treated dogs demonstrated severe tubular damage, characterized by tubular cell necrosis and apoptosis. In conclusion, although no clinical signs of renal disease were evident, the use of meglumine antimoniate in the pharmacological treatment approach of CanL-affected dogs should be carefully considered.},

We generated null mutants of the Leishmania major alkyldihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase (ADS), the first committed step of ether lipid synthesis. Enzymatic analysis and comprehensive mass spectrometric analysis showed that ads1- knock-outs lacked all ether phospholipids, including plasmalogens, LPG, and GIPLs. Leishmania ads1- thus represents the first ether lipid-synthesizing eukaryote for which a completely null mutant could be obtained. Remarkably ads1- grew well and maintained lipid rafts (detergent-resistant membranes). In virulence tests it closely resembled LPG-deficient L. major, including sensitivity to complement and an inability to survive the initial phase of macrophage infection. Likewise it retained the ability to inhibit host cell signaling and to form infectious amastigotes from the few parasites surviving the establishment defect. These findings counter current proposals that GIPLs are required for amastigote survival in the mammalian host or that parasite lyso-alkyl or alkylacyl-GPI anchors are solely responsible for inhibition of macrophage activation.},

To determine risk factors for peptic ulcer bleeding other than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Methods-Data on possible antecedent risk factors obtained in a large case control study of 1121 patients admitted to hospitals in Glasgow, Newcastle, Nottingham, Oxford, and Portsmouth with bleeding peptic ulcers were compared with the same information obtained in 989 population controls. Data were analysed by logistic regression with the calculation of odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI).


RESULTS

From a logistic regression model, oral anticoagulants (OR 7. 8; 95\% CI 2.8-21.5), previous peptic ulcer (3.8; 2.6-4.9), treatment for heart failure (5.9; 2.3-13.1), oral corticosteroid use (2.7; 1. 3-4.5), treatment for diabetes (3.1; 1.2-4.3), and current smoking (1.6; 1.2-2.0) were all independent risk factors. No association was found with use of calcium channel antagonists. Odds ratios for concomitant NSAID usage were multiplicative with the exception of current smoking.


CONCLUSIONS

Some 45\% of admissions for peptic ulcer bleeding in England and Wales in those aged 60 or more are calculated to be attributable to, or associated with, these accessory risk factors, which, together with those associated with aspirin or other NSAID use will account for over 80\% of predisposing factors to ulcer bleeding.},

Counterfeit drugs particularly affect the most disadvantaged people in poor countries. Although advances in forensic chemical analysis and simple field tests will enhance drug quality monitoring, improved access to inexpensive genuine medicines, support of drug regulatory authorities, more open reporting, vigorous law enforcement, and more international cooperation with determined political leadership will be essential to counter this threat.},

	abstract = {Migration of skilled health workers from sub-Saharan African countries has significantly increased in this century, with most countries becoming sources of migrants. Despite the growing problem of health worker migration for the effective functioning of health care systems there is a remarkable paucity and incompleteness of data. Hence, it is difficult to determine the real extent of migration from, and within, Africa, and thus develop effective forecasting or remedial policies. This global overview and the most comprehensive data indicate that the key destinations remain the USA and the UK, and that major sources are South Africa and Nigeria, but in both contexts there is now greater diversity. Migrants move primarily for economic reasons, and increasingly choose health careers because they offer migration prospects. Migration has been at considerable economic cost, it has depleted workforces, diminished the effectiveness of health care delivery and reduced the morale of the remaining workforce. Countries have sought to implement national policies to manage migration, mitigate its harmful impacts and strengthen African health care systems. Recipient countries have been reluctant to establish effective ethical codes of recruitment practice, or other forms of compensation or technology transfer, hence migration is likely to increase further in the future, diminishing the possibility of achieving the United Nations millennium development goals and exacerbating existing inequalities in access to adequate health care.},

	volume = {5},
	issn = {17424690},
	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Unlike CD4+ T cells, HIV-1 infected macrophages exhibit extended life span even upon stress, consistent with their in vivo role as long-lived HIV-1 reservoirs. Results: Here, we demonstrate that PI3K/Akt inhibitors, including clinically available Miltefosine, dramatically reduced HIV-1 production from long-living virus-infected macrophages. These PI3K/Akt inhibitors hyper-sensitize infected macrophages to extracellular stresses that they are normally exposed to, and eventually leads to cell death of infected macrophages without harming uninfected cells. Based on the data from these Akt inhibitors, we were able to further investigate how HIV-1 infection utilizes the PI3K/Akt pathway to establish the cytoprotective effect of HIV-1 infection, which extends the lifespan of infected macrophages, a key viral reservoir. First, we found that HIV-1 infection activates the well characterized pro-survival PI3K/Akt pathway in primary human macrophages, as reflected by decreased PTEN protein expression and increased Akt kinase activity. Interestingly, the expression of HIV-1 or SIV Tat is sufficient to mediate this cytoprotective effect, which is dependent on the basic domain of Tat - a region that has previously been shown to bind p53. Next, we observed that this interaction appears to contribute to the downregulation of PTEN expression, since HIV-1 Tat was found to compete with PTEN for p53 binding; this is known to result in p53 destabilization, with a consequent reduction in PTEN protein production. Conclusions: Since HIV-1 infected macrophages display highly elevated Akt activity, our results collectively show that PI3K/Akt inhibitors may be a novel therapy for interfering with the establishment of long-living HIV-1 infected reservoirs.},

	doi = {10.1086/505217},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antimonials are the mainstay of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) treatment in Africa. The increasing incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection requires alternative safe and effective drug regimens. Oral miltefosine has been proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of Indian VL but has not been studied in Africa or in persons with HIV and VL coinfection.
METHODS: We compared the efficacy of miltefosine and sodium stibogluconate (SSG) in the treatment of VL in persons in Ethiopia. A total of 580 men with parasitologically and/or serologically confirmed VL were randomized to receive either oral miltefosine (100 mg per day for 28 days) or intramuscular SSG (20 mg/kg per day for 30 days).
RESULTS: The initial cure rate was 88\% in both treatment groups. Mortality during treatment was 2\% in the miltefosine group, compared with 10\% in the SSG group. Initial treatment failure was 8\% in the miltefosine group, compared with 1\% in the SSG group. Among the 375 patients (65\%) who agreed to HIV testing, HIV seroprevalence was 29\%. Among patients not infected with HIV, initial cure, mortality, and initial treatment failure rates were not significantly different (94\% vs. 95\%, 1\% vs. 3\%, and 5\% vs. 1\% for the miltefosine and SSG groups, respectively). Initial treatment failure with miltefosine occurred in 18\% of HIV-coinfected patients, compared with treatment failure in 5\% of non-HIV-infected patients. At 6 months after treatment, 174 (60\%) of the 290 miltefosine recipients and 189 (65\%) of the 290 SSG recipients experienced cure; 30 (10\%) of 290 in the miltefosine group and 7 (2\%) of 290 in the SSG group experienced relapse, and the mortality rate was 6\% in the miltefosine group, compared with 12\% in the SSG group. HIV-infected patients had higher rates of relapse (16 [25\%] of 63 patients), compared with non-HIV-infected patients (5 [5\%] of 131).
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with miltefosine is equally effective as standard SSG treatment in non-HIV-infected men with VL. Among HIV-coinfected patients, miltefosine is safer but less effective than SSG.},

	abstract = {Cefquinome is a cephalosporin with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, including activity against enteric Gram-negative bacilli such as Escherichia coli. We utilized a neutropenic mouse model of colibacillosis to examine the pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of cefquinome, as measured by organism number in homogenized thigh cultures after 24 h of therapy. Serum drug levels following 4-fold-escalating single doses of cefquinome were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of cefquinome were linear over a dose range of 10 to 640 mg/kg of body weight. Serum half-lives ranged from 0.29 to 0.32 h. Dose fractionation studies over a 24-h dose range of 2.5 to 320 mg/kg were conducted every 3, 6, 12, or 24 h. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine which pharmacodynamic parameter best correlated with efficacy. The free percentage of the dosing interval that the serum levels exceed the MIC (fT{\textgreater}MIC) was the PK-PD index that best correlated with efficacy (R(2) = 73\% for E. coli, compared with 13\% for the maximum concentration of the free drug in serum [fCmax]/MIC and 45\% for the free-drug area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h [fAUC0-24]/MIC). Subsequently, we employed a similar dosing strategy by using 4-fold-increasing total cefquinome doses administered every 4 h to treat animals infected with four additional E. coli isolates. A sigmoid maximum-effect (Emax) model was used to estimate the magnitudes of the \%fT{\textgreater}MIC associated with net bacterial stasis, a 1-log10 CFU reduction from baseline, and a 2-log10 CFU reduction from baseline; the corresponding values were 28.01\% ± 2.27\%, 37.23\% ± 4.05\%, and 51.69\% ± 9.72\%. The potent bactericidal activity makes cefquinome an attractive option for the treatment of infections caused by E. coli.},

The cure rates with 6 months of follow-up were statistically similar: 36 of 41 evaluable miltefosine patients (88\%) versus 15 of 16 (94\%) evaluable antimony patients. However, antimony cured more rapidly, because, by 1 month after therapy, 31 of 44 miltefosine patients (70\%) compared with 16 of 16 antimony patients (100\%) had achieved cure. The two conclusions from this work are that oral miltefosine can be used for cutaneous disease in this part of Bolivia and that miltefosine was more effective for L. braziliensis in this region than for L. braziliensis in Guatemala.

The tests' positivity were: 10.8\% (ELISA), 3.9\% (IFAT), 0.8\% (rK39), 6.3\% PCR and 20.2\% (overall, at least one positive test), with no statistical correlation between positivity and clinical and laboratorial variables. Concordance among tests was low (Kappa {\textless}0.20). Prevalence of Leishmania asymptomatic infection was high in this population, reinforcing the need for attention in the evaluation of HIV patients from endemic areas.

	abstract = {Miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine, HePC) is the first effective oral agent for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. This study aimed to determine whether this oral administration alters the integrity and transport capacities of the intestinal barrier. The objectives of this study were: (i) to evaluate the cytotoxicity of HePC, (ii) to investigate the effects of HePC on paracellular and transcellular transport and (iii) to investigate the influence of HePC on three major transporters of the intestinal barrier, namely, P-glycoprotein, the human intestinal peptide transporter (PepT-1) and the monocarboxylic acid transporter (MCT-1) in Caco-2 cell monolayers, used as an in vitro model of the human intestinal barrier. We show that HePC reduced the transepithelial electrical resistance and increased D-[14C]mannitol permeability in a dose-dependent manner but had no effect on [3H]testosterone permeability, demonstrating that HePC treatment enhances paracellular permeability via an opening of the tight junction complex without affecting the transcellular route. Morphological studies using confocal fluorescence microscopy showed no perturbation of the normal distribution of ZO-1, occludin or E-cadherin but revealed a redistribution of the tight junction-associated protein claudin-1 and the perijunctional actin after incubation with HePC. Finally, HePC was found to inhibit the intestinal P-glycoprotein in the Caco-2 cell model after a single short exposure. These results suggest that HePC could modify the oral bioavailability of other therapeutic compounds absorbed via the paracellular route or which are substrates of the intestinal P-glycoprotein.},

Primers were designed in the conserved region of the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene; amplification was visualized by the pre-amplification addition of fluorescent detection reagent (FDR) and a simple UV lamp. By using a reverse-transcriptase step, the system detected infections between 10 and 100 parasites per mL. The assay was tested on a range of nucleic acid extracts from Leishmania species, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients from Sudan, and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) patients from Suriname. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP from the blood of VL patients was 83\% (N = 30) compared with microscopy of bone-marrow and lymph-node aspirates; for CL patients the observed sensitivity was 98\% (N = 43). The potential to use LAMP as a diagnostic tool for leishmaniasis is discussed.},

The burden of leishmaniasis falls disproportionately on the poorest segments of the global population. Within endemic areas, increased infection risk is mediated through poor housing conditions and environmental sanitation, lack of personal protective measures and economically driven migration and employment that bring nonimmune hosts into contact with infected sand flies. Poverty is associated with poor nutrition and other infectious diseases, which increase the risk that a person (once infected) will progress to the clinically manifested disease. Lack of healthcare access causes delays in appropriate diagnosis and treatment and accentuates leishmaniasis morbidity and mortality, particularly in women. Leishmaniasis diagnosis and treatment are expensive and families must sell assets and take loans to pay for care, leading to further impoverishment and reinforcement of the vicious cycle of disease and poverty. Public investment in treatment and control would decrease the leishmaniasis disease burden and help to alleviate poverty.},

	doi = {10.1093/jac/dky143},
	abstract = {Objectives: Leishmania parasites reside within macrophages and the direct target of antileishmanial drugs is therefore intracellular. We aimed to characterize the intracellular PBMC miltefosine kinetics by developing a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model simultaneously describing plasma and intracellular PBMC pharmacokinetics. Furthermore, we explored exposure-response relationships and simulated alternative dosing regimens.
Patients and methods: A population PK model was developed with NONMEM, based on 339 plasma and 194 PBMC miltefosine concentrations from Colombian cutaneous leishmaniasis patients [29 children (2-12 years old) and 22 adults] receiving 1.8-2.5 mg/kg/day miltefosine for 28 days.
Results: A three-compartment model with miltefosine distribution into an intracellular PBMC effect compartment best fitted the data. Intracellular PBMC distribution was described with an intracellular-to-plasma concentration ratio of 2.17 [relative standard error (RSE) 4.9\%] and intracellular distribution rate constant of 1.23 day-1 (RSE 14\%). In exploring exposure-response relationships, both plasma and intracellular model-based exposure estimates significantly influenced probability of cure. A proposed PK target for the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (day 0-28) of {\textgreater}535 mg·day/L corresponded to {\textgreater}95\% probability of cure. In linear dosing simulations, 18.3\% of children compared with 2.8\% of adults failed to reach 535 mg·day/L. In children, this decreased to 1.8\% after allometric dosing simulation.
Conclusions: The developed population PK model described the rate and extent of miltefosine distribution from plasma into PBMCs. Miltefosine exposure was significantly related to probability of cure in this cutaneous leishmaniasis patient population. We propose an exploratory PK target, which should be validated in a larger cohort study.},

	abstract = {Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite, resides and replicates as amastigotes within macrophages. The parasite inflicts the disease visceral leishmaniasis by suppressing host cell function. Neither a therapeutic vaccine nor an effective anti-leishmanial drug to reverse the immunosuppression is available. Although miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine or HPC) is a promising orally bioavailable anti-leishmanial drug, its efficacy is seriously compromised by contra-indications in pregnant women. Further rational redesigning of the drug requires studies on its mechanism of action, which is unknown at present. Because miltefosine is proposed to have immunomodulatory functions, we examined whether miltefosine exerts its anti-leishmanial functions by activating macrophages. We observed that miltefosine’s anti-leishmanial function was significantly compromised in IFN-γ-deficient macrophages suggesting the importance of endogenous IFN-γ in miltefosine-induced anti-leishmanial functions of macrophages. Miltefosine induced IFN-γ, neutralization of which reduced the anti-leishmanial functions of macrophages. IFN-γ responsiveness is reduced in L. donovani-infected macrophages but is significantly restored by miltefosine, as it enhances IFN-γ receptors and IFN-γ induced STAT-1 phosphorylation but reduced activation of SHP-1, the phosphatase implicated in the down-regulation of STAT-1 phosphorylation. Miltefosine induced protein kinase C-dependent and PI3K-dependent p38MAP kinase phosphorylation and anti-leishmanial function. Miltefosine promotes p38MAP kinase-dependent anti-leishmanial functions and IL-12-dependent Th1 response. Leishmania donovani-infected macrophages induced Th2 response but miltefosine treatment reversed the response to Th1-type. Thus, our data define for the first time the mechanistic basis of host cell-dependent anti-leishmanial function of miltefosine.},

For HAT, a novel diamidine, parfuramidine, is in phase III clinical trial for early-stage disease, but for the treatment of late-stage disease there are no new drugs and combinations of eflornithine with melarsoprol or nifurtimox have been the focus of clinical studies. For Chagas disease, different classes of compounds that have validated biochemical targets, sterol biosynthesis methylases and cysteine proteases, are in various stages of development. The genome sequences that are now available for the pathogens that cause the leishmaniases and trypanosomiases, and new methods for rapid validation of targets, are part of the solution to discover new drugs. The integration of medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, project planning and interaction with the pharma/biotech sector are essential if progress is to be made. Although there are financial constraints, the appearance of new funding sources and not-for-profit product development partnerships offers hope for drug development.},

It is classically treated with parenteral antimony or, as a last resort, amphotericin B. METHODS: We treated Bolivian mucosal leishmaniasis due to Leishmania braziliensis with the oral agent miltefosine, 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days, and followed-up for 12 months. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were evaluable. The cure rate for the 36 patients who had "mild" disease (i.e., affecting nasal skin and nasal mucosa) was 83\%. The cure rate for the 36 patients who had more extensive disease (involving the palate, pharynx, and larynx) was 58\%. Patients refused to be randomized to parenteral agents, but the cure rate for an almost contemporary group who was receiving amphotericin B (45 mg/kg over 90 days) was 7 (50\%) of 14. CONCLUSIONS: In this unrandomized trial, oral miltefosine was at least as effective as heroic doses of parenteral amphotericin B. The cure rate for miltefosine was approximately equivalent to historical cure rates using parenteral pentavalent antimony for mild and extensive disease in neighboring Peru. Although gastrointestinal side reactions do occur with miltefosine, its toxicity profile is superior to that of antimony and far superior to that of amphotericin B--in part because of the inherent attractiveness of oral versus parenteral agents. Our results suggest that miltefosine should be the treatment of choice for mucosal disease in North and South America.},

	abstract = {A rapid and accurate method to detect and quantify Leishmania parasite is urgently needed to facilitate early diagnosis of leishmaniasis and monitoring of antileishmania therapy. In this study, real-time assay was applied to estimate parasite load in clinical samples of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) patients. The mean parasite load in blood of VL patients (n = 31) was 8,372 parasites/ml, while the mean parasite load in bone marrow aspirate (BMA) was 194,962 parasites/million nucleated cells (n = 12). Parasite load was undetectable after treatment with amphotericin B (n = 9) in VL, while a residual parasite burden was detected in 2 of 6 patients following treatment with sodium antimony gluconate. Further, circulating levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-10, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2 were analysed in VL patients (n = 29) by Cytometric Bead Array to evaluate correlation with parasitic load. Interestingly, IL-10 levels correlated significantly with parasite load (r = 0.82, P{\textless}0.0001). The mean parasite load in dermal lesions of PKDL patients was 9,502 parasites/microg tissue DNA at pre-treatment stage (n = 25), with no detectable parasites after therapy (n = 5). Parasite burden was distinctly higher (P{\textless}0.0001) in nodular lesions (n = 12) (19,586 parasites/microg tissue DNA) compared to papular/macular lesions (n = 13, 193 parasites/microg tissue DNA). Further, chronic PKDL lesions showed significantly (P = 0.0166) higher parasite load in comparison with acute lesions. Results indicate that chronic, nodular cases constitute the major parasite reservoir for anthroponotic transmission. Our results establish that the high parasite load in VL is strongly correlated with a high level of IL-10, implicating IL-10 as a marker of disease severity. The assay is applicable for diagnosis as well as prognosis of both VL and PKDL, providing a simple molecular tool to monitor the efficacy of antileishmanial drugs or vaccines.},

The UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank /WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) has over the 2000–2008 period supported the development of individual and institutional grants. Although the TDR research capacity development programmes has had a substantial impact on the development of tropical disease research and research capacity in disease endemic countries, a review of the lessons learnt and benefits of this approach has never been completed. A study was conducted to analyse TDR's inputs in research capacity in endemic countries and to assist TDR in the improvement of its future activities. An analysis (by variables of gender, age, language, country of origin, country of studies, type of grant, scientific interest etc) of the grantees that have benefited from TDR support in terms of their career development and research capacity, including any important financial implications was conducted. The study identify opportunities that are a broader relevance to objectives to international development agencies such as addressing inequities such as the gender imbalance language bias towards English and building a supportive research environment in DECs in which researchers can develop their scientific career and pursue their research.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Use of miltefosine in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is hampered by its potential teratogenicity. The duration of adequate contraceptive cover in females of child-bearing potential after cessation of a potentially teratogenic drug therapy remains debated. The objective of this study was to provide a rational approach to suggest durations of contraceptive cover for various miltefosine regimens.
METHODS: A human reproductive safety threshold exposure limit was derived using animal-to-human dose conversion. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data for miltefosine in females are lacking; a previously developed population PK model and a comprehensive anthropometric dataset were used to simulate PK data for Indian female VL patients receiving miltefosine for 5, 7, 10 or 28 days. Probability of supra-threshold miltefosine exposure was used to evaluate adequate durations of post-treatment contraceptive cover for the various regimens.
RESULTS: PK data were simulated for 465 treated Indian female VL patients of child-bearing potential with a median age of 25 years (IQR 16-31 years) and median weight of 38 kg (IQR 34-42 kg). From animal reproductive toxicity studies, a human reproductive safety threshold exposure limit was derived of 24.5 μg · day/mL. Probability of 'unprotected' supra-threshold miltefosine exposure was very low ({\textless}0.2\%) for a post-treatment contraceptive cover period of 4 months for the standard 28 day regimen, and of 2 months for the shorter regimens.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study providing rational suggestions for contraceptive cover for a teratogenic drug based on animal-to-human dose conversion. For the 28 day miltefosine regimen, post-treatment contraceptive cover may be extended to 4 months, whereas for all shorter regimens 2 months may be adequate.},

	abstract = {Diagnostic material from patients with leishmaniasis is generally available as promastigotes, and proper testing for susceptibility to first-line drugs by the intracellular amastigote assay is frequently hampered by the poor infectivity of the promastigotes for the macrophage host cell. Several conditions for optimization of the in vitro metacyclogenesis and cell infectivity of Leishmania donovani, L. guyanensis, and L. braziliensis field strains obtained from patients receiving standard antimony medication were investigated. Triggering log-phase promastigotes to become amastigote-like by increasing the temperature or acidifying the culture medium was not successful. Adequate metacyclogenesis and the highest levels of macrophage infection were obtained after 5-day-old late-log-phase promastigote cultures were preconditioned at 25 degrees C to pH 5.4 for 24 h in Schneider's medium prior to infection. The susceptibility assay with primary peritoneal mouse macrophages included pentavalent antimony (Sb(V); sodium stibogluconate), trivalent antimony (Sb(III); potassium antimonyl tartrate), miltefosine, and the experimental drug PX-6518. All strains were sensitive to miltefosine (50\% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] {\textless} 10 microM) and PX-6518 (IC(50) {\textless} 2 microg/ml) but showed distinct susceptibility to Sb(V) and/or Sb(III), depending on whether they were derived from cured, relapse, or nonresponder patients. Within the available set of Leishmania species and strains, simultaneous Sb(V)-Sb(III) resistance was clearly associated with treatment failure; however, a larger set of isolates is still needed to judge the predictive value of Sb(V)-Sb(III) susceptibility profiling on treatment outcome. In conclusion, the proposed conditioning protocol further contributes toward a more standardized laboratory model for evaluation of the drug sensitivities of field isolates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL), although rare, is profoundly incapacitating. At present there is no successful treatment for this progressive protozoan infection, which is associated with the absence of specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI) to Leishmania. This disease shares features with visceral leishmaniasis (VL), including specific CMI inactivity during active disease and a heavy parasitic burden, but VL responds well to treatment. Miltefosine is the first orally administered drug which has shown efficacy in the treatment of VL; it has not been adequately evaluated in the treatment of DCL.


OBJECTIVES

To evaluate the efficacy of miltefosine in the treatment of DCL, using clinical, parasitological, histopathological and immunological criteria.


METHODS

Sixteen patients with DCL were treated with miltefosine, 2.0-2.5 mg kg(-1) daily, for variable periods of time (75-218 days). Patients were hospitalized for the first month and evaluated every 2 weeks until the termination of treatment with routine laboratory chemistry, percentage clinical improvement, presence of parasites in skin smears, growth of parasites in culture medium and in hamsters, histopathological characteristics of the granulomas, adverse side-effects, and reactivity to leishmanin skin test antigen. Further cycles of treatment were given in some of these patients, particularly after suspension of treatment was followed by relapse.


RESULTS

Patients showed dramatic clinical improvement and reduction in the parasite burden by day 15 after the initiation of treatment, which continued while treatment was maintained. By day 45, 15 patients showed 80-90\% clinical improvement. Nevertheless, suspension of treatment was followed by the development of new lesions in all but one patient. Inoculation in hamsters was observed to be the most sensitive technique to detect persisting parasites. Adverse events were very mild.


CONCLUSIONS

Miltefosine produced a dramatic clinical and parasitological response in patients with DCL and improvement continued during drug administration, but with a single exception all patients presented new lesions after suspension of treatment. There was no histological or skin test evidence to suggest the development of CMI during treatment, which may be an indispensable criterion for the evaluation of potentially effective drugs against DCL.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
In 1975–99, only 1·1\% of new therapeutic products had been developed for neglected diseases. Since then, several public and private initiatives have attempted to mitigate this imbalance. We analysed the research and development pipeline of drugs and vaccines for neglected diseases from 2000 to 2011.
Methods
We searched databases of drug regulatory authorities, WHO, and clinical trial registries for entries made between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2011. We defined neglected diseases as malaria, tuberculosis, diarrhoeal diseases, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs; WHO definition), and other diseases of poverty according to common definitions.
Findings
Of the 850 new therapeutic products registered in 2000–11, 37 (4\%) were indicated for neglected diseases, comprising 25 products with a new indication or formulation and eight vaccines or biological products. Only four new chemical entities were approved for neglected diseases (three for malaria, one for diarrhoeal disease), accounting for 1\% of the 336 new chemical entities approved during the study period. Of 148 445 clinical trials registered in Dec 31, 2011, only 2016 (1\%) were for neglected diseases.
Interpretation
Our findings show a persistent insufficiency in drug and vaccine development for neglected diseases. Nevertheless, these and other data show a slight improvement during the past 12 years in new therapeutics development and registration. However, for many neglected diseases, new therapeutic products urgently need to be developed and delivered to improve control and potentially achieve elimination.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \&\#38; AIMS

Selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors produce less gastric damage than conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), suggesting that NSAIDs cause damage by inhibiting COX-1. We tested this hypothesis in rats by using a selective COX-1 inhibitor (SC-560).


METHODS

The effects of SC-560, celecoxib (selective COX-2 inhibitor), or a combination of both inhibitors on gastric damage and prostaglandin synthesis were determined. Selectivity of the drugs for COX-1 vs. COX-2 was assessed in the carrageenan-airpouch model. A COX-1-preferential inhibitor, ketorolac, was also evaluated. The effects of these inhibitors on leukocyte adherence to vascular endothelium and on gastric blood flow were assessed.


RESULTS

SC-560 markedly reduced gastric prostaglandin synthesis and platelet COX-1 activity, but spared COX-2 and did not cause gastric damage. Celecoxib did not affect gastric prostaglandin E(2) synthesis and did not cause gastric damage. However, the combination of SC-560 and celecoxib invariably caused hemorrhagic erosion formation, comparable to that seen with indomethacin. Ketorolac caused damage only at doses that inhibited both COX isoforms, or when given with a COX-2 inhibitor. Celecoxib, but not SC-560, significantly increased leukocyte adherence, whereas SC-560, but not celecoxib, reduced gastric blood flow.


CONCLUSIONS

Inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2 is required for NSAID-induced gastric injury in the rat.},

The aim of the study therefore was to assess the therapeutic potential of miltefosine on Acanthamoeba keratitis-infected hamster eyes. The cornea of hamsters were infected with Acanthamoeba hatchetti, a human corneal isolate. On the fifth day, all the cornea were microscopically examined in order to determine the degree of infections (G, from 0 to 3). Four groups were then prepared: miltefosine (160 μM); 0.1\% propamidine isetionate plus 0.02\% polyhexnide; infected control (0.05\% ethanol in PBS) and a non-infected control (0.05\% ethanol in PBS) groups. The treatment was continued for 28 days. After the treatment, the cornea were excised and used for Acanthamoeba culture to investigate the presence of Acanthamoeba growth. Miltefosine treatment yielded much higher cure scores than propamidine isetionate plus polyhexanide. On the last day of treatment, 85\% of the miltefosine-treated eyes were graded as G0; no changes were observed in the uninfected control group eyes; G3 eyes showed only a partial improvement. Furthermore, no Acanthamoeba cells could be recovered from the miltefosine-treated eye samples. Miltefosine appeared to hold necessary therapeutic properties for the treatment of Acanthamoeba keratitis.},

	abstract = {An evaluation of Leishmania PCR was performed with bone marrow, lymph node, and blood samples from 492 patients, 60 positive controls, and 90 negative controls. Results were compared with microscopy results for Giemsa-stained smears. PCR and microscopy of lymph node and bone marrow aspirates from patients with microscopically confirmed visceral leishmaniasis (VL) were equally sensitive. However, in patients clinically suspected of having VL and in whom parasites could not be demonstrated by microscopy, PCR was positive for 12 of 23 (52.2\%) lymph node aspirates and 8 of 12 (66.7\%) bone marrow aspirates, thus confirming the clinical diagnosis of VL. With PCR on filter paper, Leishmania DNA was detected in the blood of 33 of 47 (70\%) patients with confirmed VL and in 2 of 11 (19\%) patients suspected of having VL. Positive PCR results were more frequently found for blood samples on filter paper than for samples stored in EDTA. In conclusion, PCR is a more sensitive method than microscopy for the detection of Leishmania in lymph node and bone marrow aspirates, being especially useful for the confirmation of cases of suspected VL. Blood from a finger prick may be used for the initial PCR screening of people suspected of having VL. If the PCR of blood is negative, one should perform PCR with lymph node and/or bone marrow material, because PCR with these materials is more often positive.},

The present quantification limit is approximately 0.5 pmol before split (5 fmol after 1/100 split). The relative responses were more dependent on the head group identity rather than fatty acyl composition within a phospholipid class. In general, phosphatidylcholine (PC) species are most sensitively detected followed by phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) species.

Therefore, measurement of neopterin concentrations in body fluids like serum, cerebrospinal fluid or urine provides information about activation of T helper cell 1 derived cellular immune activation. Increased neopterin production is found in infections by viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), infections by intracellular living bacteria and parasites, autoimmune diseases, malignant tumor diseases and in allograft rejection episodes. But also in neurological and in cardiovascular diseases cellular immune activation indicated by increased neopterin production, is found. Major diagnostic applications of neopterin measurements are, e.g. monitoring of allograft recipients to recognize immunological complications early. Neopterin production provides prognostic information in patients with malignant tumor diseases and in HIV-infected individuals, high levels being associated with poorer survival expectations. Neopterin measurements are also useful to monitor therapy in patients with autoimmune disorders and in individuals with HIV infection. Screening of neopterin concentrations in blood donations allows to detect acute infections in a non-specific way and improves safety of blood transfusions. As high neopterin production is associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species and with low serum concentrations of antioxidants like alpha-tocopherol, neopterin can also be regarded as a marker of reactive oxygen species formed by the activated cellular immune system. Therefore, by neopterin measurements not only the extent of cellular immune activation but also the extent of oxidative stress can be estimated.},

All substances showed at least amoebostatic effects, and some of them disrupted the amoebae, as shown by the release of cytoplasmic enzyme activity. Hexadecylphosphocholine exhibited the highest degree of cytotoxicity against trophozoites, resulting in complete cell death at a concentration as low as 40 μM, and also displayed significant cysticidal activity. Hexadecylphosphocholine may be a promising new candidate for the topical treatment of Acanthamoeba keratitis and, conceivably, even for the oral treatment of granulomatous amoebic encephalitis.},

The main objective of the study was to identify the role of adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity in patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) for management. There was a significant increase in mean ADA activity in sera of 49 patients with VL (323.71+/-184.51 IU/L) compared with 50 samples of control groups (47.11+/-24.94 IU/L) from the same endemic area (P {\textless} 0.001). ADA activities were found to be significantly decreased (50.35+/-41.35 IU/L) in follow-up cases (n = 19) after 30 days with sodium stibogluconate treatment at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day intramuscularly. The fall in the level of ADAF (after treatment) in follow-up cases correlated with the cure of disease, as evident from improvement of vital signs and symptoms and the absence of Leishmania donavani bodies in the sera. The study therefore suggests the possibility of using human serum ADA as a convenient marker to evaluate the diagnosis of VL to support the clinical findings, especially in those settings where there is a lack of highly qualified personnel and diagnostic facilities.},

We have carried out a systematic study of the alterations induced on the bioenergetic metabolism of Leishmania donovani promastigotes by HePC. Overnight incubation with HePC caused a significant decline in the intracellular ATP levels of the parasites, together with a reduction in the oxygen consumption rate and mitochondrial depolarization, while the integrity of the plasma membrane remained undamaged. In a further step, the effects of HePC on the respiratory chain were addressed in digitonized parasites. The inhibition of the oxygen consumption rate caused by HePC was not reverted either with the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone or with tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine plus ascorbate, which feeds the electron transport chain at the level of cytochrome c. These results suggest that cytochrome c oxidase is a likely target in the complex leishmanicidal mechanism of HePC. This was further confirmed from the finding that this enzyme was specifically inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by HePC, but not the cytochrome c reductase, ruling out an unspecific effect of HePC on the respiratory chain.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Observational studies and randomized controlled trials have yielded inconsistent findings about the association between the use of acid-suppressive drugs and the risk of pneumonia. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize this association.


METHODS

We searched three electronic databases (MEDLINE [PubMed], Embase and the Cochrane Library) from inception to Aug. 28, 2009. Two evaluators independently extracted data. Because of heterogeneity, we used random-effects meta-analysis to obtain pooled estimates of effect.


RESULTS

We identified 31 studies: five case-control studies, three cohort studies and 23 randomized controlled trials. A meta-analysis of the eight observational studies showed that the overall risk of pneumonia was higher among people using proton pump inhibitors (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.27, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.46, I(2) 90.5\%) and histamine(2) receptor antagonists (adjusted OR 1.22, 95\% CI 1.09-1.36, I(2) 0.0\%). In the randomized controlled trials, use of histamine(2) receptor antagonists was associated with an elevated risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia (relative risk 1.22, 95\% CI 1.01-1.48, I(2) 30.6\%).


INTERPRETATION

Use of a proton pump inhibitor or histamine(2) receptor antagonist may be associated with an increased risk of both community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Given these potential adverse effects, clinicians should use caution in prescribing acid-suppressive drugs for patients at risk.},

Monte-Carlo simulation was employed to assess dosing regimens in pediatrics based on the predicted pharmacokinetic profiles and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distributions of Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, which frequently cause infectious pediatric diseases. The probabilities of attaining target time above MIC (40\%T{\textgreater}MIC) were calculated for dosing regimens of 1-30 mg/kg with two or three times daily dosing (TID) based on simulations of 5000 pediatric patients and MICs.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION

Human visceral leishmaniasis is a serious public health problem in endemic countries because of its high potential lethality, particularly in children. Rapid diagnosis is essential to early treatment and control of visceral leishmaniasis.


OBJECTIVE

The aim was to compare three serodiagnostic tools for human visceral leishmaniasis.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

Three methods were compared: the rK39 dipstick (Kalazar detection test, Inbios International Inc.), ELISA rK26 and direct agglutination test (DAT) (KIT Biomedical Research). Fifty serum samples from patients positive for rK39 ELISA were compared from four endemic provinces in Venezuela: Nueva Esparta (Margarita island), Lara, Anzoátegui and Trujillo. Additional serum samples from 17 healthy volunteers and 25 patients with other diseases were included. The rK39 ELISA served as the baseline standard method. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and likelihood ratio were calculated for each test.


RESULTS

All methods had a positive correlation with rK39 ELISA (p{\textless}0.0001). They showed high sensitivity and specificity. The direct agglutination test and the rK39 dipstick showed high sensitivity values, 89.7\% (95\% CI: 81.34.0-98.2\%) and 94.2\% (95\% CI: 87.7-100\%), respectively, and high specificity, 81.0\% (95\% CI: 80.0-99.5\%) and 100\%. The rK26 ELISA showed good specificity, 99\% (95\% CI: 95.2-100\%), but a very low sensitivity, 37\% (95\% CI: 23.4-50.2\%).


CONCLUSION

Overall results indicated that DAT and rK39 dipstick have the highest specificity and sensitivity. Both are simple, cost-effective and field applicable tests. Therefore, they are recommended for early and accurate diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis.},

Serum adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity increases in diseases where cellular immunity is involved. Since cell-mediated immune responses play a paramount role in the pathogenesis and healing of the visceral leishmaniasis, therefore, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the serum ADA activity in different pathological conditions.


METHODS

Adenosine deaminase was determined in sera of active visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients at diagnosis and at posttreatment (n=22), healthy controls (n=15), patients with malaria (n=10), leprosy (n=10) and tuberculosis (n=10).


RESULTS

Serum levels of ADA were significantly higher in active VL patients as compared to controls and patients with other diseases. ADA levels were also raised in patients with malaria, though not significantly as compared with active VL patients. Sera from VL patients at posttreatment showed significantly decreased ADA levels over sera from patients at diagnosis.


CONCLUSIONS

The results therefore suggest that ADA is involved in the pathogenesis and could be used as a clinical marker in the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis.},

	abstract = {Regulation of the immune response directed against Leishmania is critical for the establishment of effective control of the disease. It is likely that some types of immune responses directed against Leishmania can lead to more severe clinical forms of leishmaniasis causing a poor control of the pathogen and/or pathology, while others lead to resolution of the infection with little pathology as in cutaneous leishmaniasis. To gain a better understanding of the possible role that subpopulations of T cells, and their associated cytokines have on disease progression and/or protective immune responses to L. braziliensis infection, a detailed study of the frequency of activated and memory T cells, as well as antigen specific, cytokine producing T cells was carried out. Following the determination of cytokine producing mononuclear cell populations in response to total Leishmania antigen (SLA), and to the recombinant antigen LACK, correlation analysis were performed between specific cytokine producing populations to identify models for cellular mechanisms of immunoregulation in human cutaneous leishmaniasis. These studies have shown: (1) a positive correlation between ex vivo CD45RO frequencies and antigen specific cytokine (IFN-gamma or IL-10) producing cells; (2) a negative correlation between ex vivo CD69 expression and the frequency of IFN-gamma producing cells; (3) a positive correlation amongst SLA specific, IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha and IL-10 producing lymphocytes with one another; and (4) a higher frequency of IL-10 producing, parasite specific (anti-SLA or anti-LACK), lymphocytes are correlated with a lower frequency of TNF-alpha producing monocytes, demonstrating an antigen specific delivery of IL-10 inducing negative regulation of monocyte activity.},

	abstract = {Reliable, comparable information about the main causes of disease and injury in populations, and how these are changing, is a critical input for debates about priorities in the health sector. Traditional sources of information about the descriptive epidemiology of diseases, injuries, and risk factors are generally incomplete, fragmented, and of uncertain reliability and comparability. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study has provided a conceptual and methodological framework to quantify and compare the health of populations using a summary measure of both mortality and disability, the disability-adjusted life year (DALY).This paper describes key features of the Global Burden of Disease analytic approach, which provides a standardized measurement framework to permit comparisons across diseases and injuries, as well as risk factors, and a systematic approach to the evaluation of data. The paper describes the evolution of the GBD, starting from the first study for the year 1990, summarizes the methodological improvements incorporated into GBD revisions for the years 2000-2004 carried out by the World Health Organization, and examines priorities and issues for the next major GBD study, funded by the Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation, and commencing in 2007.The paper presents an overview of summary results from the Global Burden of Disease study 2002, with a particular focus on the neglected tropical diseases, and also an overview of the comparative risk assessment for 26 global risk factors. Taken together, trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease, schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, intestinal nematode infections, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, and leprosy accounted for an estimated 177,000 deaths worldwide in 2002, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, and about 20 million DALYs, or 1.3\% of the global burden of disease and injuries. Further research is currently underway to revise and update these estimates.},

	shorttitle = {Ceftolozane/tazobactam},
	doi = {10.1007/s40265-013-0168-2},
	abstract = {Ceftolozane is a novel cephalosporin currently being developed with the β-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs), complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP). The chemical structure of ceftolozane is similar to that of ceftazidime, with the exception of a modified side-chain at the 3-position of the cephem nucleus, which confers potent antipseudomonal activity. As a β-lactam, its mechanism of action is the inhibition of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Ceftolozane displays increased activity against Gram-negative bacilli, including those that harbor classical β-lactamases (e.g., TEM-1 and SHV-1), but, similar to other oxyimino-cephalosporins such as ceftazidime and ceftriaxone, it is compromised by extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases. The addition of tazobactam extends the activity of ceftolozane to include most ESBL producers as well as some anaerobic species. Ceftolozane is distinguished from other cephalosporins by its potent activity versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including various drug-resistant phenotypes such as carbapenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ceftazidime-resistant isolates, as well as those strains that are multidrug-resistant (MDR). Its antipseudomonal activity is attributed to its ability to evade the multitude of resistance mechanisms employed by P. aeruginosa, including efflux pumps, reduced uptake through porins and modification of PBPs. Ceftolozane demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics unaffected by the coadministration of tazobactam; specifically, it follows a two-compartmental model with linear elimination. Following single doses, ranging from 250 to 2,000 mg, over a 1-h intravenous infusion, ceftolozane displays a mean plasma half-life of 2.3 h (range 1.9-2.6 h), a steady-state volume of distribution that ranges from 13.1 to 17.6 L, and a mean clearance of 102.4 mL/min. It demonstrates low plasma protein binding (20 \%), is primarily eliminated via urinary excretion (≥92 \%), and may require dose adjustments in patients with a creatinine clearance {\textless}50 mL/min. Time-kill experiments and animal infection models have demonstrated that the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic index that is best correlated with ceftolozane's in vivo efficacy is the percentage of time in which free plasma drug concentrations exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration of a given pathogen (\%fT {\textgreater}MIC), as expected of β-lactams. Two phase II clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate ceftolozane ± tazobactam in the settings of cUTIs and cIAIs. One trial compared ceftolozane 1,000 mg every 8 h (q8h) versus ceftazidime 1,000 mg q8h in the treatment of cUTI, including pyelonephritis, and demonstrated similar microbiologic and clinical outcomes, as well as a similar incidence of adverse effects after 7-10 days of treatment, respectively. A second trial has been conducted comparing ceftolozane/tazobactam 1,000/500 mg and metronidazole 500 mg q8h versus meropenem 1,000 mg q8h in the treatment of cIAI. A number of phase I and phase II studies have reported ceftolozane to possess a good safety and tolerability profile, one that is consistent with that of other cephalosporins. In conclusion, ceftolozane is a new cephalosporin with activity versus MDR organisms including P. aeruginosa. Tazobactam allows the broadening of the spectrum of ceftolozane versus β-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli including ESBLs. Potential roles for ceftolozane/tazobactam include empiric therapy where infection by a resistant Gram-negative organism (e.g., ESBL) is suspected, or as part of combination therapy (e.g., with metronidazole) where a polymicrobial infection is suspected. In addition, ceftolozane/tazobactam may represent alternative therapy to the third-generation cephalosporins after treatment failure or for documented infections due to Gram-negative bacilli producing ESBLs. Finally, the increased activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam versus P. aeruginosa, including MDR strains, may lead to the treatment of suspected and documented P. aeruginosa infections with this agent. Currently, ceftolozane/tazobactam is being evaluated in three phase III trials for the treatment of cUTI, cIAI, and VABP.},

MCV and MCH increased during follow up but microcytosis persisted up to a year after cure. Low serum iron and transferrin concentration, low total iron binding capacity and normal to high serum ferritin levels were found in 10 patients and are consistent with 'anaemia of chronic inflammation'. Bone marrows of 15 patients before treatment were normo- to hypercellular with increased erythropoietic activity. Low haemosiderin content of the bone marrow was consistent with iron deficiency, but normalization of Hb without iron suppletion would argue against a major role of iron deficiency. Coagulation studies did not indicate diffuse intravascular coagulation. Splenomegaly seems the most important factor in the causation of the pancytopenia.

This constitutes a major obstacle for the diagnosis of the disease and for the study of the effectiveness of treatment schedules and urges the development of improved detection methods. In this study, quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA) technology was used to detect and quantify Leishmania parasites in skin biopsy samples from CL patients. The assay is based on the detection of a small subunit rRNA (18S rRNA), which may allow for the detection of viable parasites. The QT-NASBA assay was evaluated using in vitro-cultured promastigotes and amastigotes and 2-mm skin biopsy samples from Old and New World CL patients. The study demonstrated that the lower detection limit of the QT-NASBA was two parasites per biopsy sample. Parasites could be quantified in a range of 2 to 11,300,000 parasites per biopsy sample. The QT-NASBA could detect levels of parasites 100-fold lower than those detected by conventional PCR. Test evaluation revealed that the QT-NASBA had a sensitivity of 97.5\% and a specificity of 100\% in the present study. The QT-NASBA is a highly sensitive and specific method that allows quantification of both Old and New World Leishmania parasites in skin biopsy samples and may provide an important tool for diagnosis as well as for monitoring the therapy of CL patients.},

We validated a simple resazurin-based fluorimetric assay using promastigotes to track natural MIL tolerance in Leishmania donovani parasites from VL cases (n = 17) against standard amastigote assay, in two different labs in India. The inter-stage MIL susceptibility correlated strongly (r = 0.70, p = 0.0018) using J774.A.1 macrophage cell line-based amastigote assay and fluorescence-based resazurin assay for promastigotes. Investigation of inter-stage MIL susceptibility for the same set of clinical isolates in another lab also showed a strong correlation (r = 0.72, p = 0.0012) using mouse peritoneal macrophages for amastigote assay and resazurin-based alamar blue assay for promastigotes. Additionally, parasites from post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) lesions (n = 7, r = 0.78, p = 0.046) and MIL-induced parasites (r = 0.92, p = 0.0001; n = 3) also exhibited a strongly correlated inter-stage miltefosine susceptibility. Thus, our results support the utility of resazurin assay as a simplified biological tool for MIL susceptibility monitoring in clinical isolates from MIL-treated VL/PKDL patients.},

	abstract = {The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis prompted the reintroduction of para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) to protect companion anti-tuberculosis drugs from additional acquired resistance. In sub-Saharan Africa, MDR/XDR tuberculosis with HIV coinfection is common, and concurrent treatment of HIV infection and MDR/XDR tuberculosis is required. Out of necessity, patients receive multiple drugs, and PAS therapy is frequent; however, neither potential drug interactions nor the effects of HIV infection are known. Potential drug-drug interaction with PAS and the effect of HIV infection was examined in 73 pulmonary tuberculosis patients; 22 (30.1\%) were HIV coinfected. Forty-one pulmonary MDR or XDR tuberculosis patients received 4 g PAS twice daily, and in a second crossover study, another 32 patients were randomized, receiving 4 g PAS twice daily or 8 g PAS once daily. A PAS population pharmacokinetic model in two dosing regimens was developed; potential covariates affecting its pharmacokinetics were examined, and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted evaluating the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic index. The probability of target attainment (PTA) to maintain PAS levels above MIC during the dosing interval was estimated by simulation of once-, twice-, and thrice-daily dosing regimens not exceeding 12 g daily. Concurrent efavirenz (EFV) medication resulted in a 52\% increase in PAS clearance and a corresponding {\textgreater}30\% reduction in mean PAS area under the concentration curve in 19 of 22 HIV-M. tuberculosis-coinfected patients. Current practice recommends maintenance of PAS concentrations at ≥1 μg/ml (the MIC of M. tuberculosis), but the model predicts that at only a minimum dose of 4 g twice daily can this PTA be achieved in at least 90\% of the population, whether or not EFV is concomitantly administered. Once-daily dosing of 12 g PAS will not provide PAS concentrations exceeding the MIC over the entire dosing interval if coadministered with EFV, while 4 g twice daily ensures concentrations exceeding MIC over the entire dosing interval, even in HIV-infected patients who received EFV.},

To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the OligoC-TesT and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification coupled to oligochromatography (NASBA-OC) for molecular detection of Leishmania in blood from patients with confirmed visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and healthy endemic controls from Kenya.


METHODS

Blood specimens of 84 patients with confirmed VL and 98 endemic healthy controls from Baringo district in Kenya were submitted to both assays.


RESULTS

The Leishmania OligoC-TesT showed a sensitivity of 96.4\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 90-98.8\%) and a specificity of 88.8\% (95\% CI: 81-93.6\%), while the sensitivity and specificity of the NASBA-OC were 79.8\% (95\% CI: 67-87\%) and 100\% (95\% CI: 96.3-100\%), respectively.


CONCLUSION

Our findings indicate high sensitivity of the Leishmania OligoC-TesT on blood while the NASBA-OC is a better marker for active disease.},

We reviewed the evidence and potential for combination therapy, and the criteria for the choice of drugs in such regimens. The first phase 2 results of combination regimens are promising, and have identified effective and safe regimens as short as 8 days. Several phase 3 trials are underway or planned in the Indian subcontinent and east Africa. The limited data available suggest that combination therapy is more cost-effective and reduces indirect costs for patients. Additional advantages are reduced treatment duration (8-17 days), with potentially better patient compliance and lesser burden on the health system. Only limited data are available on how best to prevent acquired resistance. Patients who are coinfected with visceral leishmaniasis and HIV could be a reservoir for development and spread of drug-resistant strains, calling for special precautions. The identification of a short, cheap, well-tolerated combination regimen that can be given in ambulatory care and needs minimal clinical monitoring will most likely have important public health implications. Effective monitoring systems and close regulations and policy will be needed to ensure effective implementation. Whether combination therapy could indeed help delay resistance, and how this is best achieved, will only be known in the long term.},

	abstract = {The alkyl phosphocholine drug miltefosine is structurally similar to natural substrates of the fungal virulence determinant phospholipase B1 (PLB1), which is a potential drug target. We determined the MICs of miltefosine against key fungal pathogens, correlated antifungal activity with inhibition of the PLB1 activities (PLB, lysophospholipase [LPL], and lysophospholipase-transacylase [LPTA]), and investigated its efficacy in a mouse model of disseminated cryptococcosis. Miltefosine inhibited secreted cryptococcal LPTA activity by 35\% at the subhemolytic concentration of 25 microM (10.2 microg/ml) and was inactive against mammalian pancreatic phospholipase A2 (PLA2). At 250 microM, cytosolic PLB, LPL, and LPTA activities were inhibited by 25\%, 51\%, and 77\%, respectively. The MICs at which 90\% of isolates were inhibited (MIC90s) against Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Cryptococcus neoformans, Cryptococcus gattii, Aspergillus fumigatus, Fusarium solani, Scedosporium prolificans, and Scedosporium apiospermum were 2 to 4 microg/ml. The MICs of miltefosine against Candida tropicalis (n = 8) were 2 to 4 microg/ml, those against Aspergillus terreus and Candida parapsilosis were 8 microg/ml (MIC90), and those against Aspergillus flavus (n = 8) were 2 to 16 microg/ml. Miltefosine was fungicidal for C. neoformans, with rates of killing of 2 log units within 4 h at 7.0 microM (2.8 microg/ml). Miltefosine given orally to mice on days 1 to 5 after intravenous infection with C. neoformans delayed the development of illness and mortality and significantly reduced the brain cryptococcal burden. We conclude that miltefosine has broad-spectrum antifungal activity and is active in vivo in a mouse model of disseminated cryptococcosis. The relatively small inhibitory effect on PLB1 enzyme activities at concentrations exceeding the MIC by 2 to 20 times suggests that PLB1 inhibition is not the only mechanism of the antifungal effect.},

Semi-quantitative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and dissolution testing were used to measure active pharmaceutical ingredient content against internationally acceptable standards. 35\% of all samples tested failed either or both tests, and were substandard. Further, 33\% of treatments collected were artemisinin monotherapies, most of which (78\%) were manufactured in disobservance of an appeal by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to withdraw these clinically inappropriate medicines from the market. The high persistence of substandard drugs and clinically inappropriate artemisinin monotherapies in the private sector risks patient safety and, through drug resistance, places the future of malaria treatment at risk globally.},

The present work reports the characterization of the first ABC subfamily G (ABCG)-like transporter, LiABCG4, in the protozoan parasite Leishmania. LiABCG4 localized mainly to the parasite plasma membrane. Overexpression of this half-transporter reduced the accumulation of phosphatidylcholine analogues and conferred resistance to alkyl-phospholipids. Likewise, when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the protein localized to the yeast plasma membrane and conferred resistance to alkyl-phospholipids. Post-Golgi secretory vesicles isolated from a LiABCG4-overexpressing yeast mutant contained the leishmanial ABC transporter and exhibited ATP-dependent, vanadate-sensitive transport of phosphatidylcholine analogues from the cytosolic to the lumenal leaflet of the vesicle membrane. Cross-linking showed dimerization of LiABCG4. These results suggest that LiABCG4 is involved in the active transport of phosphatidylcholine and resistance to alkyl-phospholipids in Leishmania.},

	abstract = {The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in leishmaniasis patients are, to a great extent, unknown. We examined and characterized the pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in a group of patients with Old World (Leishmania major) cutaneous leishmaniasis. Miltefosine plasma concentrations were determined in samples taken during and up to 5 months after the end of treatment from 31 Dutch military personnel who contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and were treated with 150 mg miltefosine/day for 28 days. Samples were analyzed with a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 4 ng/ml. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed with nonlinear mixed-effect modeling, using NONMEM. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine could best be described by an open two-compartment disposition model, with a first elimination half-life of 7.05 days and a terminal elimination half-life of 30.9 days. The median concentration in the last week of treatment (days 22 to 28) was 30,800 ng/ml. The maximum duration of follow-up was 202 days after the start of treatment. All analyzed samples contained a concentration above the LLOQ. Miltefosine is eliminated from the body much slower than previously thought and is therefore still detectable in human plasma samples taken 5 to 6 months after the end of treatment. The presence of subtherapeutic miltefosine concentrations in the blood beyond 5 months after treatment might contribute to the selection of resistant parasites, and moreover, the measures for preventing the teratogenic risks of miltefosine treatment should be reconsidered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of lymphocytes in the specific defence against L. infantum has been well established, but the part played by polynuclear neutrophil (PN) cells in controlling visceral leishmaniasis was much less studied. In this report we examine in vivo the participation of PN in early and late phases of infection by L. infantum.
RESULTS: Promastigote phagocytosis and killing occurs very early after infection, as demonstrated by electron microscopy analyses which show in BALB/c mouse spleen, but not in liver, numerous PN harbouring ultrastructurally degraded parasites. It is shown, using mAb RB6-8C5 directed against mature mouse granulocytes, that in chronically infected mice, long-term PN depletion did not enhance parasite counts neither in liver nor in spleen, indicating that these cells are not involved in the late phase of L. infantum infection. In acute stage of infection, in mouse liver, where L. infantum load is initially larger than that in spleen but resolves spontaneously, there was no significant effect of neutrophils depletion. By contrast, early in infection the neutrophil cells crucially contributed to parasite killing in spleen, since PN depletion, performed before and up to 7 days after the parasite inoculation, resulted in a ten-fold increase of parasite burden.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together these data show that neutrophil cells contribute to the early control of the parasite growth in spleen but not in liver and that these cells have no significant effect late in infection in either of these target organs.},

To identify gaps and challenges in DDM\&S, an inventory of skills and competencies currently available in academia, industry, and clinical practice was obtained through survey. The survey outcomes revealed benefits, weaknesses, and hurdles for the implementation of DDM\&S. In addition, the survey indicated that no consensus exists about the knowledge, skills, and attributes required to perform DDM\&S activities effectively. Hence, a landscape of technical and conceptual requirements for DDM\&S was identified and serves as a basis for developing a framework of competencies to guide future education and training in DDM\&S.},

The proportion of both helper and suppressor CD4+ cells and of cells with NK and cytotoxic T phenotypes were depressed. Successful chemotherapy normalized these parameters with the exception of activated monocytes. Thus, the impaired cell-mediated immunity in human Leishmania donovani infection is primarily due to a decrease in the proportion and possibly the activity of helper CD4+ cells, while suppressor cells do not seem to play a relevant role.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect more than one billion people, mainly living in developing countries. For most of these NTDs, treatment is suboptimal. To optimize treatment regimens, clinical pharmacokinetic studies are required where they have not been previously conducted to enable the use of pharmacometric modeling and simulation techniques in their application, which can provide substantial advantages.
OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to provide a systematic overview and summary of all clinical pharmacokinetic studies in NTDs and to assess the use of pharmacometrics in these studies, as well as to identify which of the NTDs or which treatments have not been sufficiently studied.
METHODS: PubMed was systematically searched for all clinical trials and case reports until the end of 2015 that described the pharmacokinetics of a drug in the context of treating any of the NTDs in patients or healthy volunteers.
RESULTS: Eighty-two pharmacokinetic studies were identified. Most studies included small patient numbers (only five studies included {\textgreater}50 subjects) and only nine (11 \%) studies included pediatric patients. A large part of the studies was not very recent; 56 \% of studies were published before 2000. Most studies applied non-compartmental analysis methods for pharmacokinetic analysis (62 \%). Twelve studies used population-based compartmental analysis (15 \%) and eight (10 \%) additionally performed simulations or extrapolation. For ten out of the 17 NTDs, none or only very few pharmacokinetic studies could be identified.
CONCLUSIONS: For most NTDs, adequate pharmacokinetic studies are lacking and population-based modeling and simulation techniques have not generally been applied. Pharmacokinetic clinical trials that enable population pharmacokinetic modeling are needed to make better use of the available data. Simulation-based studies should be employed to enable the design of improved dosing regimens and more optimally use the limited resources to effectively provide therapy in this neglected area.},

Males accounted for 88\% of cases with concurrent VL and AIDS and 65\% of those with VL alone. The mean CD4 count and antileishmanial antibody titre were lower and recurrence of VL and death were more likely with co-infection.

	abstract = {This study was initiated by the laboratories and control department of the French Health Products Safety Agency (AFSSAPS) as part of the fight against the public health problem of rising counterfeit and imitation medicines. To test the discriminating ability of Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS), worse cases scenarios were first considered for the discrimination of various pharmaceutical final products containing the same Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) with different excipients, such as generics of proprietary medicinal products (PMP). Two generic databases were explored: low active strength hard capsules of Fluoxetine and high strength tablets of Ciprofloxacin. Then 4 other cases involving suspicious samples, counterfeits and imitations products were treated. In all these cases, spectral differences between samples were studied, giving access to API or excipient contents information, and eventually allowing manufacturing site identification. A chemometric background is developed to explain the optimisation methodology, consisting in the choices of appropriate pretreatments, algorithms for data exploratory analyses (unsupervised Principal Component Analysis), and data classification (supervised cluster analysis, and Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy). Results demonstrate the high performance of NIRS, highlighting slight differences in formulations, such as 2.5\% (w/w) in API strength, 1.0\% (w/w) in excipient and even coating variations ({\textless}1\%, w/w) with identical contents, approaching the theoretical limits of NIRS sensitivity. All the different generic formulations were correctly discriminated and foreign PMP, constituted of formulations slightly different from the calibration ones, were also all discriminated. This publication addresses the ability of NIRS to detect counterfeits and imitations and presents the NIRS as an ideal tool to master the global threat of counterfeit drugs.},

Results  Despite the high incidence of the disease, most people in Gedaref State know little about VL, and help at a treatment centre is usually sought only after traditional remedies and basic allopathic drugs have failed. Factors barring access to treatment are: lack of money for treatment and transport, impassability of roads, work priorities, severe cultural restrictions of women's decision-making power and distance to the next health center. Conclusions  To provide more VL patients with access to treatment in this highly endemic area, diagnostic and treatment services should be decentralized.

To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the OligoC-TesT and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification coupled to oligochromatography (NASBA-OC) for molecular detection of Leishmania in blood from patients with confirmed visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and healthy endemic controls from Kenya.


METHODS

Blood specimens of 84 patients with confirmed VL and 98 endemic healthy controls from Baringo district in Kenya were submitted to both assays.


RESULTS

The Leishmania OligoC-TesT showed a sensitivity of 96.4\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 90-98.8\%) and a specificity of 88.8\% (95\% CI: 81-93.6\%), while the sensitivity and specificity of the NASBA-OC were 79.8\% (95\% CI: 67-87\%) and 100\% (95\% CI: 96.3-100\%), respectively.


CONCLUSION

Our findings indicate high sensitivity of the Leishmania OligoC-TesT on blood while the NASBA-OC is a better marker for active disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is no effective oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), a disseminated intracellular protozoal infection that occurs worldwide. Miltefosine, an alkyl phospholipid developed as an oral antineoplastic agent, is active against visceral infection in animal models. We tested safety, tolerance, and efficacy of miltefosine in kala-azar.
METHODS: Oral doses of miltefosine were given to six groups of five Indian men for 28 days: 50 mg every second day (group 1), 100 mg every second day (group 2), 100 mg/day (group 3), 150 mg/day (group 4), 200 mg/day (group 5), and 250 mg/day (group 6). Assessment for apparent cure--taken as an afebrile state with decreased spleen size and a splenic-aspirate parasite-density score of 0--was done on days 14 and 28. Definitive cure at 8 months required a parasite-free bone-marrow aspirate and no clinical evidence of relapse.
FINDINGS: 21 of 30 patients were apparently cured on day 14. Transient episodes of vomiting and diarrhoea, were common during weeks 1-2 and were seen in 22 patients. Four other patients in groups 5 and 6 had miltefosine withdrawn after 7-10 days because of vomiting. One patient in group 6 developed renal insufficiency and severe diarrhoea and died on day 21. On day 28, all 29 remaining patients were apparently cured. By 8 months, seven of ten patients in groups 1 and 2 had relapsed; however, 18 of 19 patients treated daily (groups 3-6) appeared to be cured. Among the 21 definitive cures were the four patients treated for 10 days or less and 12 for whom previous therapy with pentavalent antimony had failed.
INTERPRETATION: Treatment with miltefosine at 100-150 mg/day for 4 weeks has promise as an effective oral treatment of visceral leishmaniasis including antimony-resistant infection.},

We have previously shown the involvement of LtrMDR1, a P-glycoprotein-like transporter belonging to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily, in miltefosine resistance in Leishmania. Here we show that overexpression of LtrMDR1 increases miltefosine efflux, leading to a decrease in drug accumulation in the parasites. Although LtrMDR1 modulation might be an efficient way to overcome this resistance, a main drawback associated with the use of P-glycoprotein inhibitors is related to their intrinsic toxicity. In order to diminish possible side effects, we have combined suboptimal doses of modulators targeting both the cytosolic and transmembrane domains of LtrMDR1. Preliminary structure-activity relationships have allowed us to design a new and potent flavonoid derivative with high affinity for the cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains. As modulators directed to the transmembrane domains, we have selected one of the most potent dihydro-β-agarofuran sesquiterpenes described, and we have also studied the effects of two of the most promising, latest-developed modulators of human P-glycoprotein, zosuquidar (LY335979) and elacridar (GF120918). The results show that this combinatorial strategy efficiently overcomes P-glycoprotein-mediated parasite miltefosine resistance by increasing intracellular miltefosine accumulation without any side effect in the parental, sensitive, Leishmania line and in different mammalian cell lines.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Miltefosine is the first oral drug with demonstrable success in treating visceral leishmaniasis in adults. Because approximately one-half of the visceral leishmaniasis patients worldwide are children, we performed a Phase I/II dose ranging study in the pediatric population in India. METHODS: Thirty-nine (39) children (defined as {\textless} 12 years of age) with visceral leishmaniasis demonstrated by parasites in splenic aspirates, were treated with oral miltefosine daily for 28 days: 21 patients received 1.5 mg/kg/day (Group A); and 18 patients received 2.5 mg/kg/day (Group B). About one-half of these children had failed prior antileishmanial treatment. RESULTS: All patients were parasitologically negative and symptomatically improved by the end of therapy on Day 28 of therapy; the initial parasitologic cure rate was 100\%. Two patients in each treatment group relapsed with fever, splenomegaly and parasite-positive splenic aspirates by the end of the 6-month follow-up. The per protocol final clinical cure rate was 19 of 21 = 90\% in Group A and 15 of 17 = 88\% in Group B. Miltefosine was well-tolerated. As per the adult experience, gastrointestinal adverse events were seen: 33 and 39\% of children experienced vomiting and 5 and 17\% experienced diarrhea in Groups A and B, respectively, but all episodes were mild to moderate in severity and commonly lasted {\textless}1 day without symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSION: Oral miltefosine was safe and approximately 90\% effective in this initial clinical trial of childhood visceral leishmaniasis.},

The bidirectional permeabilities of digoxin, estrone-3-sulfate (E3S), and sulfasalazine, substrates of P-gp, BCRP/MRP2 and unspecified efflux transporters, respectively, were examined in Caco-2 and MDR-MDCK cells in the absence and presence of transporter inhibitors: CsA (P-gp), FTC (BCRP) and MK571 (MRP). Digoxin showed significant efflux ratios (ER) in both Caco-2 (ER=17) and MDR-MDCK (ER=120), whereas E3S and sulfasalazine only showed significant efflux in Caco-2 (ER=15 and 88, respectively) but not in MDR-MDCK cells (ER=1.1 and 1.3, respectively). CsA at 10muM showed complete inhibition of digoxin efflux, partial inhibition of E3S efflux and no effect on sulfasalazine efflux. FTC and MK571 had different inhibitory effects on the efflux of these compounds. The present study shows evidence of the functional expression of multiple efflux transporter systems in Caco-2 cells. Although the use of Caco-2 cells and selected inhibitors of efflux transporters can provide useful mechanistic information on drug-drug interactions involving efflux transporters, the potential cross-reaction of inhibitors with multiple transporters makes it difficult to discern the role of individual transporters in drug transport or drug-drug interactions.},

For 10 years it has been licensed in India for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a fatal neglected parasitic disease. It is the first and still the only oral drug that can be used to treat VL and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). The standard 28 day miltefosine monotherapy regimen is well tolerated, except for mild gastrointestinal side effects, although its teratogenic potential severely hampers its general use in the clinic and roll-out in national elimination programmes. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine are mainly characterized by its long residence time in the body, resulting in extensive drug accumulation during treatment and long elimination half-lives. At the moment, different combination therapy strategies encompassing miltefosine are being tested in multiple controlled clinical trials in various geographical areas of endemicity, both in South Asia and East Africa. We here review the most salient pre-clinical and clinical pharmacological aspects of miltefosine, its mechanism of action against Leishmania parasites and other pathogens, and provide a systematic overview of the efficacy and safety data from all clinical trials of miltefosine, either alone or in combination, in the treatment of VL and CL.},

Early clinical trials were limited because of dose-limiting gastrointestinal toxicity, and parenteral dosing of this class of agents is not possible because of their hemolytic properties; therefore, related compounds with an improved therapeutic index were developed. Toxicity was minimized and efficacy improved by using a loading dose/maintenance dose schedule, and therefore, this schedule was carried into clinical trials. This phase I trial enrolled 42 patients with incurable solid malignancies. The starting doses were 100 mg p.o. x four doses (every 6 hours) load followed by a 50 mg p.o. once daily maintenance dose with escalation of either component in successive dose levels. No treatment related deaths occurred. The maximum-tolerated dose was determined to be 150 mg p.o. x four doses load and 100 mg p.o. once daily maintenance. Dose-limiting toxicities such as nausea, diarrhea, dehydration, and fatigue were seen early during the loading phase and were surmountable with the use of prophylactic 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, dexamethasone, and loperamide. Toxicities during the chronic phase were difficult to manage and, given that pharmacokinetic data showed biologically active serum concentrations (based on preclinical data), raised the question of less frequent maintenance dosing. Pharmacokinetic data confirmed the maintenance of stable drug levels with chronic dosing and the long half-life. One partial response was seen, as were multiple patients with stable disease beyond course 2. These results suggest perifosine activity in sarcoma and perhaps renal cell carcinoma (stable disease in two patients who continued for 6 and 14 courses), thus justifying additional investigation of this agent in a phase II sarcoma trial.},

	abstract = {The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in leishmaniasis patients are, to a great extent, unknown. We examined and characterized the pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in a group of patients with Old World (Leishmania major) cutaneous leishmaniasis. Miltefosine plasma concentrations were determined in samples taken during and up to 5 months after the end of treatment from 31 Dutch military personnel who contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and were treated with 150 mg miltefosine/day for 28 days. Samples were analyzed with a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 4 ng/ml. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed with nonlinear mixed-effect modeling, using NONMEM. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine could best be described by an open two-compartment disposition model, with a first elimination half-life of 7.05 days and a terminal elimination half-life of 30.9 days. The median concentration in the last week of treatment (days 22 to 28) was 30,800 ng/ml. The maximum duration of follow-up was 202 days after the start of treatment. All analyzed samples contained a concentration above the LLOQ. Miltefosine is eliminated from the body much slower than previously thought and is therefore still detectable in human plasma samples taken 5 to 6 months after the end of treatment. The presence of subtherapeutic miltefosine concentrations in the blood beyond 5 months after treatment might contribute to the selection of resistant parasites, and moreover, the measures for preventing the teratogenic risks of miltefosine treatment should be reconsidered.},

The characteristics of HePC incorporation into the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 were investigated in order to understand its oral absorption mechanism. The results provide evidence for the involvement of a carrier-mediated mechanism, since the association of HePC at the apical pole of Caco-2 cells was (1) saturable as a function of time with a rapid initial incorporation over 5 min followed by a more gradual increase; (2) saturable as a function of concentration over the range studied (2-200 microM) with a saturable component which followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (apparent K (m) 15.7 micromol/L, V (max) 39.2 nmol/mg protein/h) and a nonspecific diffusion component; (3) partially inhibited by low temperature and ATP depletion, indicating the temperature and energy-dependence of the uptake process. Moreover, we demonstrated, by an albumin back-extraction method, that HePC is internalized via translocation from the outer to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and that HePC may preferentially diffuse through intact raft microdomains. In conclusion, our results suggest that incorporation of HePC at the apical membrane of Caco-2 cells may occur through a passive diffusion followed by a translocation in the inner membrane leaflet through an active carrier-mediated mechanism.},

In 2003, a stratified random sample survey was conducted in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos) to study the availability and quality of antimalarials in the private sector. In 2012, this survey was repeated to allow a statistically valid analysis of change through time. The counterfeit detection device 3 (CD-3) was used to assess packaging quality in the field and HPLC and mass spectroscopy analysis chemical analysis performed. The availability of oral artesunate monotherapies had significantly decreased from 22.9\% (22) of 96 outlets in southern Laos in 2003 to 4.8\% (7) of 144 outlets in 2012 (P {\textless} 0.0001). All the samples collected in the 2012 survey contained the correct active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in contrast to the 21 (84\%) falsified artesunate samples found in the 2003 survey. Although none of the medicines found in 2012 survey had evidence for falsification, 25.4\% (37) of the samples were outside the 90–110\% pharmacopeial limits of the label claim, suggesting that they were substandard or degraded. Results obtained from this survey show that patients are still exposed to poorly manufactured drugs or to ineffective medicines such as chloroquine. The quality of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) used in Laos needs to be monitored, since falsified ACTs would have devastating consequences in public health.},

There are significant differences in the sensitivity of these species both to the standard drugs, for example, pentavalent antimonials and miltefosine, and those on clinical trial, for example, paromomycin. Over 60\% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis in Bihar State, India, do not respond to treatment with pentavalent antimonials. This is now considered to be due to acquired resistance. Although this class of drugs has been used for over 60 years for leishmaniasis treatment, it is only in the past 2 years that the mechanisms of action and resistance have been identified, related to drug metabolism, thiol metabolism, and drug efflux. With the introduction of new therapies, including miltefosine in 2002 and paromomycin in 2005-2006, it is essential that there be a strategy to prevent the emergence of resistance to new drugs; combination therapy, monitoring of therapy, and improved diagnostics could play an essential role in this strategy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Miltefosine (MIL), the only oral drug for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), is currently the first-line therapy in the VL elimination program of the Indian subcontinent. Given the paucity of anti-VL drugs and the looming threat of resistance, there is an obvious need for close monitoring of clinical efficacy of MIL.
METHODS: In a cohort study of 120 VL patients treated with MIL in Nepal, we monitored the clinical outcomes up to 12 months after completion of therapy and explored the potential role of drug compliance, parasite drug resistance, and reinfection.
RESULTS: The initial cure rate was 95.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 92.2-99.4) and the relapse rate at 6 and 12 months was 10.8\% (95\% CI, 5.2-16.4) and 20.0\% (95\% CI, 12.8-27.2) , respectively. No significant clinical risk factors of relapse apart from age {\textless}12 years were found. Parasite fingerprints of pretreatment and relapse bone marrow isolates within 8 patients were similar, suggesting that clinical relapses were not due to reinfection with a new strain. The mean promastigote MIL susceptibility (50\% inhibitory concentration) of isolates from definite cures was similar to that of relapses. Although more tolerant strains were observed, parasite resistance, as currently measured, is thus not likely involved in MIL treatment failure. Moreover, MIL blood levels at the end of treatment were similar in cured and relapsed patients. Conclusions: Relapse in one-fifth of the MIL-treated patients observed in our study is an alarming signal for the VL elimination campaign, urging for further review and cohort monitoring.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alternative treatments for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) are required in East Africa. Paromomycin sulphate (PM) has been shown to be efficacious for VL treatment in India.
METHODS: A multi-centre randomized-controlled trial (RCT) to compare efficacy and safety of PM (20 mg/kg/day for 21 days) and PM plus sodium stibogluconate (SSG) combination (PM, 15 mg/kg/day and SSG, 20 mg/kg/day for 17 days) with SSG (20 mg/kg/day for 30 days) for treatment of VL in East Africa. Patients aged 4-60 years with parasitologically confirmed VL were enrolled, excluding patients with contraindications. Primary and secondary efficacy outcomes were parasite clearance at 6-months follow-up and end of treatment, respectively. Safety was assessed mainly using adverse event (AE) data.
FINDINGS: The PM versus SSG comparison enrolled 205 patients per arm with primary efficacy data available for 198 and 200 patients respectively. The SSG \& PM versus SSG comparison enrolled 381 and 386 patients per arm respectively, with primary efficacy data available for 359 patients per arm. In Intention-to-Treat complete-case analyses, the efficacy of PM was significantly lower than SSG (84.3\% versus 94.1\%, difference = 9.7\%, 95\% confidence interval, CI: 3.6 to 15.7\%, p = 0.002). The efficacy of SSG \& PM was comparable to SSG (91.4\% versus 93.9\%, difference = 2.5\%, 95\% CI: -1.3 to 6.3\%, p = 0.198). End of treatment efficacy results were very similar. There were no apparent differences in the safety profile of the three treatment regimens.
CONCLUSION: The 17 day SSG \& PM combination treatment had a good safety profile and was similar in efficacy to the standard 30 day SSG treatment, suggesting suitability for VL treatment in East Africa.

Combination regimens including AmBisome and miltefosine are safe and effective in India, but there are no published data from trials of combination therapies including these drugs from Africa.
METHODS: A phase II open-label, non-comparative randomized trial was conducted in Sudan and Kenya to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three treatment regimens: 10 mg/kg single dose AmBisome plus 10 days of SSG (20 mg/kg/day), 10 mg/kg single dose AmBisome plus 10 days of miltefosine (2.5mg/kg/day) and miltefosine alone (2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days). The primary endpoint was initial parasitological cure at Day 28, and secondary endpoints included definitive cure at Day 210, and pharmacokinetic (miltefosine) and pharmacodynamic assessments.
RESULTS: In sequential analyses with 49-51 patients per arm, initial cure was 85\% (95\% CI: 73-92) in all arms. At D210, definitive cure was 87\% (95\% CI: 77-97) for AmBisome + SSG, 77\% (95\% CI 64-90) for AmBisome + miltefosine and 72\% (95\% CI 60-85) for miltefosine alone, with lower efficacy in younger patients, who weigh less. Miltefosine pharmacokinetic data indicated under-exposure in children compared to adults.
CONCLUSION: No major safety concerns were identified, but point estimates of definitive cure were less than 90\% for each regimen so none will be evaluated in Phase III trials in their current form. Allometric dosing of miltefosine in children needs to be evaluated.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01067443.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess patient adherence to unsupervised single-drug miltefosine treatment for visceral leishmaniasis and to identify the factors influencing adherence.
METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 171 patients with Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in three healthcare settings in Nepal. Adherence was assessed through pill count, checking of treatment cards and adherence questionnaires, as well as miltefosine concentration measurements at the end of treatment. Poor adherence was defined as less than 90\% of required capsules taken.
RESULTS: Patient adherence to miltefosine was 83\%. Predictors of adherence were being the male sex (OR = 2.60, 95\% CI 1.02-6.67) and knowing the duration of treatment (OR = 3.05, 95\% CI 1.16-8.04). Adherence was also better for patients who were literate and knew the side effects of treatment. Gastrointestinal side effects and negligence after the resolution of clinical symptoms of VL were the main reasons for poor adherence. Poor adherence was associated (though not statistically significant) with future relapse.
CONCLUSION: Effective counselling during the treatment, a short take-home message on VL and on side effects and action of miltefosine, and follow-up visits are the best way to prevent poor adherence. Single end-of-treatment measurements of miltefosine concentrations as objective assessment of adherence would only be useful in addition to the subjective assessments when substantial doses of miltefosine have been missed.},

An assay combining cell culture and real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is reported here to verify drug efficacy against C. parvum in vitro. The monolayers of Human ileocecal adenocarcinoma cells (HCT-8) were infected by sporozoites excysted directly on the cells and were incubated with monensin, halofuginone bromide and hexadecylphosphocholine until 45h post infection (p.i.). The genomic DNA was extracted at 3, 27 and 45h p.i. and subjected to qPCR targeting the 70kDa heat shock protein gene to quantify the development of C. parvum. The reliability of the method was validated by testing of monensin and halofuginone bromide, which are well known to be effective in vitro. With the dose dependency monensin and halofuginone showed a maximum inhibition of 98.15\% and 98.05\% at 0.144 and 25microM, respectively, compared with non-treated controls at the endpoint incubation, confirming previous reports. The reduction of the parasite DNA reproduction over 27h p.i. compared with 3h p.i. was found to be as 97-99\% in 0.144microM monensin and 99\% in 25microM halofuginone treated cells. The new antileishmanial compound hexadecylphosphocholine (24.5microM, Miltefosine) showed 78-98\% inhibition at 45h p.i., however, the reproduction of parasite DNA was reduced to 96-98\% over 27h p.i. The method has the potential to easily and reliably assess anticryptosporidial compounds in adequately equipped routine laboratories.},

	abstract = {Only anecdotal data are available on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of miltefosine in children suffering from visceral leishmaniasis (VL). While failure rates were higher in children with VL, steady-state concentrations appeared lower than those seen with adults. We hypothesized that the current linear dosage (in milligrams per kilogram of body weight) is too low for children and that a new dosing algorithm based on an appropriate body size model would result in an optimal exposure. A population PK analysis was performed on three historic pooled data sets, including Indian children, Indian adults, and European adults. Linear and allometric scaling of PK parameters by either body weight or fat-free mass (FFM) was evaluated for body size models. Based on the developed PK model, a dosing algorithm for miltefosine in children and adults was proposed and evaluated in silico. The population PK model employing allometric scaling fitted best to the pooled miltefosine data. Allometric scaling by FFM reduced between-subject variability, e.g., for drug clearance, from 49.6\% to 32.1\%. A new allometric miltefosine dosing algorithm was proposed. Exposure to miltefosine was lower in children than adults receiving 2.5 mg/kg/day: a C(max) of 18.8 μg/ml was reached by 90\% of adults and 66.7\% of children. The allometric daily dose resulted in similar levels of exposure to miltefosine for adults and children. The use of a new allometric dosing algorithm for miltefosine in VL patients results in optimal exposure to miltefosine in both adults and children and might improve clinical outcome in children.},

We examined and characterized the pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in a group of patients with Old World (Leishmania major) cutaneous leishmaniasis. Miltefosine plasma concentrations were determined in samples taken during and up to 5 months after the end of treatment from 31 Dutch military personnel who contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and were treated with 150 mg miltefosine/day for 28 days. Samples were analyzed with a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 4 ng/ml. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed with nonlinear mixed-effect modeling, using NONMEM. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine could best be described by an open two-compartment disposition model, with a first elimination half-life of 7.05 days and a terminal elimination half-life of 30.9 days. The median concentration in the last week of treatment (days 22 to 28) was 30,800 ng/ml. The maximum duration of follow-up was 202 days after the start of treatment. All analyzed samples contained a concentration above the LLOQ. Miltefosine is eliminated from the body much slower than previously thought and is therefore still detectable in human plasma samples taken 5 to 6 months after the end of treatment. The presence of subtherapeutic miltefosine concentrations in the blood beyond 5 months after treatment might contribute to the selection of resistant parasites, and moreover, the measures for preventing the teratogenic risks of miltefosine treatment should be reconsidered.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To evaluate changes in serum concentrations of acute-phase proteins in dogs with leishmaniosis during short-term therapy in accordance with 2 treatment protocols and determine whether concentrations of acute-phase proteins could be used to monitor the initial response of dogs to treatment.


ANIMALS

12 dogs naturally infected with Leishmania infantum.


PROCEDURE

Dogs were allocated into 2 groups. Dogs of group 1 were treated by use of meglumine antimonate (100 mg/kg, SC, q 24 h) administered concurrently with allopurinol (15 mg/kg, PO, q 12 h) for 20 days and then with allopurinol alone at the same dosage for the subsequent 30 days. Dogs of group 2 were treated by administration of allopurinol alone (15 mg/kg, PO, q 12 h) for 60 days). Blood samples were obtained before and during treatment for measurement of serum concentrations of acute-phase proteins and determination of CBC counts, serum biochemical analyses, and electropherograms.


RESULTS

All dogs evaluated in the study had increased concentrations of C-reactive protein, haptoglobin, and ceruloplasmin at the time of diagnosis of leishmaniosis. Mean concentration of serum amyloid A before treatment was also increased, but some of the dogs had concentrations of serum amyloid A that were within the reference range. Concentrations of C-reactive protein and ceruloplasmin decreased significantly in all dogs at the end of the study period.


CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE

Measurement of concentrations of selected acute-phase proteins, such as C-reactive protein or ceruloplasmin, could be used to evaluate the initial response of dogs with leishmaniosis to treatment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although mucosal leishmaniasis is a prominent disease, it has been studied only to a limited extent. It is classically treated with parenteral antimony or, as a last resort, amphotericin B. METHODS: We treated Bolivian mucosal leishmaniasis due to Leishmania braziliensis with the oral agent miltefosine, 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days, and followed-up for 12 months. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were evaluable. The cure rate for the 36 patients who had "mild" disease (i.e., affecting nasal skin and nasal mucosa) was 83\%. The cure rate for the 36 patients who had more extensive disease (involving the palate, pharynx, and larynx) was 58\%. Patients refused to be randomized to parenteral agents, but the cure rate for an almost contemporary group who was receiving amphotericin B (45 mg/kg over 90 days) was 7 (50\%) of 14. CONCLUSIONS: In this unrandomized trial, oral miltefosine was at least as effective as heroic doses of parenteral amphotericin B. The cure rate for miltefosine was approximately equivalent to historical cure rates using parenteral pentavalent antimony for mild and extensive disease in neighboring Peru. Although gastrointestinal side reactions do occur with miltefosine, its toxicity profile is superior to that of antimony and far superior to that of amphotericin B--in part because of the inherent attractiveness of oral versus parenteral agents. Our results suggest that miltefosine should be the treatment of choice for mucosal disease in North and South America.},

	abstract = {Neopterin, a compound derived from GTP, represents a precursor molecule of biopterin that is an essential cofactor in neurotransmitter synthesis. We have recently reported that in vivo as well as in vitro immune responses are accompanied by an increased release of neopterin and that this phenomenon can be used for the biochemical monitoring of diseases accompanied by hyperimmune stimulation. This article deals with the cellular origin and the control of this immune response-associated neopterin release in vitro. Using highly purified or monoclonal cellular reagents we demonstrate that macrophages (M phi) stimulated with supernatants from activated T cells release large amounts of neopterin into culture supernatants. Further experiments involving induction of neopterin release from M phi with various human recombinant interferons (IFNs) or neutralization of the effect of T cell supernatants with various monoclonal anti-IFN antibodies revealed immune IFN as the active principle. It thus appears that a metabolic pathway so far exclusively known in context with the generation of an essential cofactor of neurotransmitter-synthesis during immune responses is also activated in M phi under stringent control by immune IFN-like lymphokines.},

In the present study, we have tested the effects of 1-O-hexadecylphosphocholine (miltefosine) against strains of T. cruzi that are partially resistant (strain Y) and highly resistant (strain Colombiana) to the drugs in clinical use. As expected, epimastigotes of strain Colombiana showed higher levels of resistance to benznidazole than those of strain Y. However, the level of resistance to miltefosine was the same for both strains. This alkylphospholipid was also extremely toxic against intracellular amastigotes of both strains. This ether-lipid analogue induced in a dose-dependent manner the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha and nitric oxide (NO) radicals by infected and noninfected macrophages, suggesting that miltefosine may activate macrophages in vitro. Nevertheless, the cytotoxic effect of miltefosine against intracellular amastigotes was independent of the amount of NO produced by the infected macrophages since the same dose-response curves for miltefosine were observed when the NO production was blocked by the NO synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-l-arginine monoacetate. Preliminary in vivo studies with BALB/c mice infected with strain Y indicated that oral miltefosine promoted survival and reduced the parasitemia to levels comparable to those observed when benznidazole was used. Four months after treatment, no parasites were detected in the blood or spleen tissue sections maintained in culture. Together, these results support the hypothesis that miltefosine may be used for the treatment of Chagas' disease, including cases caused by resistant strains of T. cruzi.},

Traditional treatment with pentavalent antimony injections has become ineffective in the area with the world’s highest prevalence of disease (North Bihar, India) and is becoming less effective elsewhere as well.

Given daily under medical supervision for 4 weeks, it cures 94\% of patients (both children and adults) and is reasonably safe. Miltefosine has great potential for improving access to treatment and overall control of VL and will be critical in the VL elimination campaign in the Indian subcontinent, but must be safeguarded or will be lost if misused. Its main limitations are adherence (and hence potential for selection of drug resistant parasites) and teratogenicity (pregnancy must be avoided during treatment and the following two months). This calls for responsible deployment, setting in place mechanisms to protect female patients in child-bearing age, monitoring effects and optimizing adherence in real-life conditions through directly observed therapy. One option to protect the useful life-span of miltefosine consists in shortening treatment duration by combining it with another drug.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE

We sought to estimate visceral leishmaniasis (VL) burden in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal and document care-seeking behaviour for VL to provide baseline information for monitoring the VL elimination program and identify options for improved case finding and management.


DESIGN

A cross-sectional study using cluster sampling (clusters being villages) of 4 VL endemic districts was used in order to document all current and existing VL cases over the preceding 12 mo. Extended (in-depth) interviews were conducted in a subsample of households to explore (a) VL-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the population; (b) use of VL care by patients; and (c) delay between onset of symptoms, diagnosis, and start of treatment, as well as treatment interruption. Findings were discussed with national program managers and policy makers to develop improved strategies.


RESULTS

Screening for VL was done in 18,933 households (106,425 inhabitants). The estimated annual incidence of VL in the endemic districts was on average 22 times higher than the elimination target of less than one case per 10,000 inhabitants in 2015. This incidence varied widely between study sites, from 9.0 to 29.8 per 10,000 inhabitants. The percentage of newly detected cases through the household screening was high in the districts least covered by health-care services (particularly Rajshahi, Bangladesh, 49\%; and to a lesser extent Vaishali in Bihar, India, 32.5\%), and much lower in districts with greater availability of VL care (Muzaffarpur, India, 3.8\%). On average 267 houses had to be visited, i.e., at least three to four working days per health worker, to identify a new VL (ranging from 1,432 houses in Muzaffarpur, India to only 166 houses in Rajshahi, Bangladesh). Knowledge of the disease and its vectors was good in India and Nepal but poor in Bangladesh (Rajshahi) where very little attention has been given to VL over the last decades. Although all socio-demographic indicators showed high levels of poverty, people in India preferred private medical practitioners for the treatment of VL, whereas in Nepal, and even more in Bangladesh, the public health-care sector was preferred. Delays between onset of symptoms and diagnosis as well as start of treatment was high. Reported non-adherence to treatment was particularly high in the more under-served districts and was mainly due to lack of resources.


DISCUSSION

The findings suggest that (a) house-to-house screening may be useful in highly endemic districts with a poor passive case detection system, but further evidence on case finding adapted to local conditions has to be collected; (b) strengthening the quality of the public health sector is imperative in the three countries, especially in India, with its largely unregulated private-sector provision of VL care.},

Dose fractionation pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies in mice indicated that the driver of PA-824 in vivo efficacy is the time during which the free drug concentrations in plasma are above the MIC (fT{\textgreater}MIC). In this study, a panel of closely related potent bicyclic 4-nitroimidazoles was profiled in both in vivo PK and efficacy studies. In an established murine TB model, the efficacy of diverse nitroimidazole analogs ranged between 0.5 and 2.3 log CFU reduction compared to untreated controls. Further, a retrospective analysis was performed for a set of seven nitroimidazole analogs to identify the PK parameters that correlate with in vivo efficacy. Our findings show that the in vivo efficacy of bicyclic 4-nitroimidazoles correlated better with lung PK than with plasma PK. Further, nitroimidazole analogs with moderate-to-high volume of distribution and Lung to plasma ratios of {\textgreater}2 showed good efficacy. Among all the PK-PD indices, total lung T{\textgreater}MIC correlated the best with in vivo efficacy (rs = 0.88) followed by lung Cmax/MIC and AUC/MIC. Thus, lung drug distribution studies could potentially be exploited to guide the selection of compounds for efficacy studies, thereby accelerating the drug discovery efforts in finding new nitroimidazole analogs.},

METHODS: Patients with solid tumours received perifosine at dosages ranging from 100-800mg/week. Eligibility criteria included life expectancy{\textgreater}12weeks, WHO performance status2, normal blood, liver and renal functions and no recent anticancer treatment. Drug concentrations were analysed by HPLC-MS/MS. RESULTS: Thirty six patients were recruited (75\% males, mean age 54.7years, performance status 1 in 72.2\%). Adverse events included nausea (69.4\%), diarrhoea (55.6\%), vomiting (52.8\%) and abdominal pain (13.9\%). Antiemetic regimens including glucocorticoids, dopamine antagonists and 5-HT3-antagonists were used as treatment and/or prophylaxis in 50\% of the patients. Though MTD was formally not reached with 800mg/week, the treatment discontinuation due to diarrhoea and vomiting likely related to perifosine in two cases led to the decision to stop further dose escalation. Pharmacokinetics after a single dose were median t(max)=8.0-24.2h, median t(1/2)=81.0-115.9h and mean(geo) CL/f=0.28-0.43mL/min/kg. Urinary excretion was below 1\%. Perifosine slightly accumulated and steady state was nearly reached after 2-3weeks. CONCLUSION: Oral perifosine was tolerable up to 600mg/week in cancer patients when administered with meal and prophylactic antiemetics. Based on its half-life of about 4days, a weekly regimen may be appropriate.},

	abstract = {We have shown, in a previous publication, that nontoxic concentrations of hexadecylphosphocholine exert an antiproliferative effect on HepG2 cells. Hexadecylphosphocholine also interferes with the biosynthesis of cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine. We have now extended our studies to try to establish the molecular mechanism by which hexadecylphosphocholine disrupts cholesterol homeostasis. Using radiolabelled substrates we determined the effect of hexadecylphosphocholine on cholesterol synthesis, the destiny of cholesterol from low-density lipoprotein and the transport of cholesterol between the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum. Protein levels and gene expression of the main proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis were analysed by western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively. HepG2 cells exposed to hexadecylphosphocholine showed an increase in cholesterol biosynthesis when acetate, but not mevalonate, was used as a substrate. The activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) and low-density lipoprotein receptor, as well as the corresponding mRNA expression, increased after 24 h of treatment with hexadecylphosphocholine. Cholesteryl linoleate in low-density lipoprotein uptake and further hydrolysis of these esters increased but the cholesterol esterification was reduced after 6 h of treatment with alkylphosphocholine. Cholesterol transport from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum was impaired by hexadecylphosphocholine. In conclusion, hexadecylphosphocholine interfered with the transport of cholesterol from the cell surface to the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a depletion of cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum and a deregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis. The accumulation of cholesterol within the cell and the reduction in phosphatidylcholine synthesis produces an alteration in the phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol ratio that may well be responsible for the antiproliferative activity exhibited by hexadecylphosphocholine in HepG2 cells.},

The 12 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis had serum neopterin levels below the upper limit of the normal range. All 16 patients with visceral leishmaniasis had elevated levels of serum neopterin before treatment. In six out of seven patients with visceral leishmaniasis followed during treatment neopterin levels decreased to values below the upper limit of the normal range (10 nmol l(-1)). Sequential measurements of serum neopterin levels may be useful for monitoring therapeutic efficacy in patients with visceral leishmaniasis.},

	abstract = {Over the past few decades, since the introduction of histamine H2-receptor antagonists, proton-pump inhibitors, cyclo-oxygenase-2-selective anti-inflammatory drugs (coxibs), and eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection, the incidence of peptic ulcer disease and ulcer complications has decreased. There has, however, been an increase in ulcer bleeding, especially in elderly patients. At present, there are several management issues that need to be solved: how to manage H. pylori infection when eradication failure rates are high; how best to prevent ulcers developing and recurring in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and aspirin users; and how to treat non-NSAID, non-H. pylori-associated peptic ulcers. Looking for H. pylori infection, the overt or surreptitious use of NSAIDs and/or aspirin, and the possibility of an acid hypersecretory state are important diagnostic considerations that determine the therapeutic approach. Combined treatment with antisecretory therapy and antibiotics for 1–2 weeks is the first-line choice for H. pylori eradication therapy. For patients at risk of developing an ulcer or ulcer complications, it is important to choose carefully which anti-inflammatory drugs, nonselective NSAIDs or coxibs to use, based on a risk assessment of the patient, especially if the high-risk patient also requires aspirin. Testing for and eradicating H. pylori infection in patients is recommended before starting NSAID therapy, and for those currently taking NSAIDs, when there is a history of ulcers or ulcer complications. Understanding the pathophysiology and best treatment strategies for non-NSAID, non-H. pylori-associated peptic ulcers presents a challenge.},

	abstract = {Standard antituberculosis (anti-TB) therapy requires the use of multiple drugs for a minimum of 6 months, with variable outcomes that are influenced by a number of microbiological, pathological, and clinical factors. This is despite the availability of antibiotics that have good activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles in plasma. However, little is known about the distribution of widely used antituberculous agents in the pulmonary lesions where the pathogen resides. The rabbit model of TB infection was used to explore the hypothesis that standard drugs have various abilities to penetrate lung tissue and lesions and that adequate drug levels are not consistently reached at the site of infection. Using noncompartmental and population pharmacokinetic approaches, we modeled the rate and extent of distribution of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and moxifloxacin in rabbit lung and lesions. Moxifloxacin reproducibly showed favorable partitioning into lung and granulomas, while the exposure of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide in lesions was markedly lower than in plasma. The extent of penetration in lung and lesions followed different trends for each drug. All four agents distributed rapidly from plasma to tissue with equilibration half-lives of less than 1 min to an hour. The models adequately described the plasma concentrations and reasonably captured actual lesion concentrations. Though further refinement is needed to accurately predict the behavior of these drugs in human subjects, our results enable the integration of lesion-specific pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) indices in clinical trial simulations and in in vitro PK-PD studies with M. tuberculosis.},

Eight (35\%) of 23 fake artesunate samples contained the wrong active ingredients, which were identified as different erythromycins and paracetamol. Raman spectroscopy identified calcium carbonate as an excipient in 9 (39\%) of 23 fake samples. Multivariate unsupervised pattern recognition results indicated two major clusters of artesunate counterfeits, those with counterfeit foil stickers and containing calcium carbonate, erythromycin, and paracetamol, and those with counterfeit holograms and containing starch but without evidence of erythromycin or paracetamol.},

Oral miltefosine has not been evaluated for pediatric cutaneous leishmaniasis.Methods. A randomized, noninferiority clinical trial with masked evaluation was conducted at 3 locations in Colombia where Leishmania panamensis and Leishmania guyanensis predominated. One hundred sixteen children aged 2-12 years with parasitologically confirmed cutaneous leishmaniasis were randomized to directly observed treatment with meglumine antimoniate (20 mg Sb/kg/d for 20 days; intramuscular) (n = 58) or miltefosine (1.8-2.5 mg/kg/d for 28 days; by mouth) (n = 58). Primary outcome was treatment failure at or before week 26 after initiation of treatment. Miltefosine was noninferior if the proportion of treatment failures was ≤15\% higher than achieved with meglumine antimoniate (1-sided test, α = .05).Results. Ninety-five percent of children (111/116) completed follow-up evaluation. By intention-to-treat analysis, failure rate was 17.2\% (98\% confidence interval [CI], 5.7\%-28.7\%) for miltefosine and 31\% (98\% CI, 16.9\%-45.2\%) for meglumine antimoniate. The difference between treatment groups was 13.8\%, (98\% CI, -4.5\% to 32\%) (P = .04). Adverse events were mild for both treatments.Conclusions. Miltefosine is noninferior to meglumine antimoniate for treatment of pediatric cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania (Viannia) species. Advantages of oral administration and low toxicity favor use of miltefosine in children.Clinical Trial Registration. NCT00487253.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Miltefosine (MIL), the only oral drug for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), is currently the first-line therapy in the VL elimination program of the Indian subcontinent. Given the paucity of anti-VL drugs and the looming threat of resistance, there is an obvious need for close monitoring of clinical efficacy of MIL.
METHODS: In a cohort study of 120 VL patients treated with MIL in Nepal, we monitored the clinical outcomes up to 12 months after completion of therapy and explored the potential role of drug compliance, parasite drug resistance, and reinfection.
RESULTS: The initial cure rate was 95.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 92.2-99.4) and the relapse rate at 6 and 12 months was 10.8\% (95\% CI, 5.2-16.4) and 20.0\% (95\% CI, 12.8-27.2) , respectively. No significant clinical risk factors of relapse apart from age {\textless}12 years were found. Parasite fingerprints of pretreatment and relapse bone marrow isolates within 8 patients were similar, suggesting that clinical relapses were not due to reinfection with a new strain. The mean promastigote MIL susceptibility (50\% inhibitory concentration) of isolates from definite cures was similar to that of relapses. Although more tolerant strains were observed, parasite resistance, as currently measured, is thus not likely involved in MIL treatment failure. Moreover, MIL blood levels at the end of treatment were similar in cured and relapsed patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Relapse in one-fifth of the MIL-treated patients observed in our study is an alarming signal for the VL elimination campaign, urging for further review and cohort monitoring.},

This study describes parasite kinetics in the blood of visceral leishmaniasis patients treated with liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) or a preformed fat emulsion of amphotericin B (ApL) using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR).

Methods
Forty-six patients were treated with a single dose (15 mg/kg of body weight) of either L-AmB (n = 13) or ApL (n = 33). qPCR was used to estimate parasite kinetics by detection of Leishmania donovani DNA using kinetoplast DNA-specific primers in peripheral blood samples using an absolute quantification method.

Results
The mean parasite load decreased from baseline (day 0) values of 894.07 and 980.48 to 71.72 and 211.52 parasite genomes/mL at day 7 in L-AmB and ApL groups, respectively, and at day 30 these further declined to 8.30 and 133.98 parasite genomes/mL, respectively. At day 30 post-treatment evaluation, the decline in parasite load was significantly greater (P = 0.024) with L-AmB compared with ApL. Four of 33 patients in the ApL group failed treatment (1 primary failure and 3 relapses) with the presence of parasites, whereas all patients in the L-AmB group were cured at 6 month follow-up.

Conclusions
qPCR can be a tool to measure parasite dynamics accurately and provide a marker to measure the efficacy of various drugs. It can be used as a test of cure, allowing us to do away with invasive and risky methods such as splenic or bone marrow aspiration.},

	abstract = {Gastric ulcer disease remains widespread; a stressful lifestyle and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) make significant contributions to this pathological situation. The findings overviewed here support the idea that glucocorticoid hormones released in response to acute stress or NSAIDs act as gastroprotective substances and exert many of the same actions in the stomach as prostaglandins (PGs) and nitric oxide (NO) as well as capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons. Glucocorticoids exert a gastroprotective effect by both maintaining local defensive factors (mucosal blood flow and mucus production) and inhibiting pathogenic elements (gastric motility and microvascular permeability). Furthermore, they exert gastroprotective actions in co-operation with PGs, NO, and the afferent neurons; and their compensatory action is observed when the protective mechanism provided by either of these factors is impaired. The gastroprotective action of glucocorticoids is also associated with maintenance of general body homeostasis, including blood glucose levels and systemic blood pressure. In conclusion, glucocorticoids released in response to acute stress or NSAIDs are naturally occurring protective factors that play an important role in maintenance of the gastric mucosal integrity. This led us to re-evaluate the traditional paradigm that glucocorticoid hormones produced during activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis are ulcerogenic in the stomach.},

The extent of oxidation, deamidation, and chain cleavages were measured by the ratio of peak areas of the nonmodified peptide vs. the sum of peak area of the nonmodified and modified peptides in the same LC-MS analysis. The subtle but distinct differences were found in the recombinant human growth from the three manufacturers (the follow-on, counterfeit, and the original innovator products). In relative comparison, the follow-on product had the highest degree of oxidation at methionine residues, followed by the counterfeit product, and the original innovator product had the least amount of oxidation at all three sites with the similar oxidation order. In cases, the oxidation order was Met14 {\textgreater} Met125 {\textgreater} Met170. In contrast, the follow-on had the least amount of deamidation at aspargine (Asn149), and the counterfeit had the highest degree of deamidation at this site. For the chain cleavage, the follow-on product had the highest cleavage occurring at T 10 peptide (between Asn99 and Ser100), the counterfeit had the highest cleavage on T4 peptide, (between Glu30 and Phe31), and the original innovator product with the least amount of cleavages on both sites. These subtle but distinct differences are likely because of nonidentical manufacturing, formulation procedures, and storage conditions.},

Here we report the application of this new genotyping method to naturally infected clinical samples for the differentiation of New and Old World Leishmania species. Of the newly developed assay and four currently applied diagnostic tests (i.e., in vitro cultivation, serology, and two other molecular assays using either the small subunit-internal transcribed spacer sequence or a repetitive genomic sequence), the miniexon assay showed the highest sensitivity, 89.7\%, compared to 70.6, 57.1, 51.7, and 79.3\%, respectively. Species differentiation was robust and reliable compared with that by two other Leishmania genotyping techniques. The assay provides a valuable tool for the identification of Leishmania directly from clinical samples and enables determination of the infecting species by a facile technique with high discrimination power. Since Leishmania causes a broad spectrum of diseases distinguished by different parasite and host factors, detection and characterization of the infecting species is crucial for the confirmation of a diagnosis as well as the establishment of the clinical prognosis and the initiation of an adequate therapeutic approach. The miniexon PCR-RFLP assay will facilitate such determination and might improve diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis.},

The concentrations of ER and CP in the plasma, urine and feces were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a fluorescence detector. The plasma concentrations of ER and CP could be determined up to 24 hr and 32 hr after i.v. and s.c. administrations at doses of 5.0 and 7.5 mg/kg BW, respectively. CP concentrations were always lower than those of parental drug. The s.c. bioavailability of ER was 52.36 ± 4.24\% and 72.12 ± 5.39\% at doses of 5.0 and 7.5 mg/kg BW, respectively. Both ER and CP were detectable in urine and feces up to 24 hr. ER and CP were mainly excreted via the urine. Based on the pharmacokinetic data and PK-PD indices, s.c. administration of ER at a dose of 5 and 7.5 mg/kg BW might be appropriate for the treatment of susceptible bacterial diseases in Thai swamp buffaloes.},

Pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) understanding of this combination is critical for optimal clinical dose selection. This study focuses on the determination of an integrated PK/PD approach for aztreonam/avibactam across multiple clinical Enterobacteriaceae strains.
METHODS: Six clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates expressing MBLs and ESBLs were studied in an in vitro hollow-fibre infection model (HFIM) using various dosing regimens simulating human-like PK for aztreonam/avibactam. The neutropenic murine thigh infection model was used for in vivo validation against two bacterial strains.
RESULTS: MIC values of aztreonam/avibactam for the isolates ranged from 0.125 to 8 mg/L. Using a constant infusion of avibactam at 4 mg/L, the aztreonam PK/PD index was observed as \% fT {\textgreater}MIC. Studies performed in the presence of a fixed dose of aztreonam revealed that the efficacy of avibactam correlates best with percentage of time above a critical threshold concentration of 2-2.5 mg/L. These conclusions translated well to the efficacy observed in the murine thigh model, demonstrating in vivo validation of the in vitro PK/PD target.
CONCLUSIONS: PK/PD evaluations for aztreonam/avibactam in HFIM yielded a single target across strains with a wide MIC range. This integrated approach could be easily applied for forecasting clinically efficacious doses for β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations.},

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is of higher priority than cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) as it is a fatal disease in the absence of treatment. Anthroponotic VL foci are of special concern as they are at the origin of frequent and deathly epidemics (e.g. Sudan). Leishmaniasis burden remains important: 88 countries, 350 million people at risk, 500,000 new cases of VL per year, 1-1.5 million for CL and DALYs: 2.4 millions. Most of the burden is concentrated on few countries which allows clear geographic priorities. Leishmaniasis is still an important public health problem due to not only environmental risk factors such as massive migrations, urbanisation, deforestation, new irrigation schemes, but also to individual risk factors: HIV, malnutrition, genetic, etc em leader Leishmaniasis is part of those diseases which still requires improved control tools. Consequently WHO/TDR research for leishmaniasis has been more and more focusing on the development of new tools such as diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines. The ongoing effort has already produced significant results. The newly available control tools should allow a scaling up of control activities in priority areas. In anthroponotic foci, the feasibility of getting a strong impact on mortality, morbidity and transmission, is high.},

Methods Mouse peritoneal macrophages (PEMs), mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMPhi), human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (PBMPhi) and differentiated THP-1 cells were infected with L. donovani. Cultures were incubated with sodium stibogluconate, amphotericin B deoxycholate (Fungizone((R))), miltefosine or paromomycin sulphate over six concentrations in 3-fold serial dilutions for 5 days. Analysis was based on percentage inhibition of infected macrophages and EC(50)/EC(90) values estimated using sigmoidal curve-fitting. Results The rank order of drug activity was the same in the different macrophage populations: amphotericin B {\textgreater} miltefosine {\textgreater} sodium stibogluconate {\textgreater} paromomycin. However, significant (P {\textless} 0.05) differences were observed between populations.

We found that growth factor-induced Akt/PKB activation in these cells is dependent on PI3K and that all three ALPs inhibited this pathway in a dose-dependent manner.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The hollow fiber system model of tuberculosis (HFS-TB) is designed to perform pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) experiments, and hence the design of optimal doses and dose schedules for the treatment of tuberculosis. To determine if this model is useful for deriving PK/PD data relevant to clinical outcomes, we compared its quantitative output to that from clinical trials.
METHODS: We performed a PubMed search to identify clinical studies performed with antituberculosis therapy in which PK/PD data and/or parameters were documented or a dose-scheduling study design was employed. The search period was from January 1943 to December 2012. All clinical studies were published prior to HFS-TB experiments. Bias minimization was done according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Clinical publications were scored for quality of evidence, with 1 as the highest score (randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses of such studies), and 4 as the lowest score.
RESULTS: We identified 17 studies that examined the same parameters as in 8 HFS-TB studies. Fifteen of 17 studies had a quality-of-evidence score of 1. The sterilizing and bactericidal effect rates for isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol were the same in the HFS-TB as in patients. Time to emergence of resistance for monotherapy was the same as in patients. The PK/PD indices associated with efficacy were the same in HFS-TB as in patients for all drugs examined.
CONCLUSIONS: The HFS-TB model is highly accurate at identifying optimal drug exposures, doses, and dosing schedules for use in the clinic.},

	abstract = {Recently, it was revealed that generic miltefosine capsules for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis, a fatal parasitic disease, were possibly counterfeit products. Here we report on the methods to characterize and identify miltefosine in pharmaceutical products and the procedures that were used to assess the quality of these suspected counterfeit products. Characterization and identification of miltefosine were done with liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Moreover, a simple, rapid and inexpensive colorimetric test was developed and evaluated for the detection of miltefosine in pharmaceutical products that can be used in the field. The complementary analytical techniques presented here were able to determine qualitatively or (semi-)quantitatively the presence or absence of miltefosine in pharmaceutical preparations and could identify suspected counterfeit miltefosine capsules. This finding of a suspected counterfeit drug intended to treat a neglected disease in a resource-poor country emphasizes the urgent need to develop more simple inexpensive assays to evaluate drug quality for use in the field.},

The biopsy revealed Leishmania amastigotes; Leishmania major was identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).(11 )Leishmania serology (indirect immunofluorescence test) was positive at 1 : 160 (normal, {\textless} or = 1 : 40). Ten weeks earlier, the patient had spent a 1-week biking holiday in central Tunisia. Two weeks after returning to Germany, he noticed the flaring up of multiple insect bites ({\textgreater} 40) contracted in Tunisia on both arms. The lesions increased in size and axillary lymph node enlargement occurred. Some of the nodular lesions disappeared spontaneously and some increased in size and showed central ulceration. When we first saw the patient, he had six lesions on his right arm and one on his left arm. The largest lesion was on the dorsum of the right hand (Fig. 1) and showed an indurated edge and central ulceration. Before starting systemic treatment, the patient decided to wait a few weeks in case spontaneous improvement occurred. However, 8 weeks later, the ulceration had further increased in size (Fig. 2) from a diameter of 2 cm initially to a diameter of 5 cm. Regional lymphatic spread with palpable nodules along the adjacent lymphatic vessel had occurred. With the patient's informed consent, treatment with oral miltefosine, according to his body weight of 96 kg, was started at 50 mg three times daily for 28 days. The treatment was well tolerated without any subjective side-effects reported. Liver enzymes, serum creatinine, and urea were monitored during treatment. There was a mild increase in liver enzymes during the third week of treatment: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 49 U/L (normal, {\textless} 35 U/L); alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 107 U/L (normal, {\textless} 45 U/L); this resolved spontaneously. Ten days after completion of treatment, the rolled edge had disappeared and the central ulcer had almost healed (Fig. 3). Figure 4 shows the lesion 5 months after completion of treatment.},

Almost all untreated patients die, and all the effective agents have been parenteral. Miltefosine is an oral agent that has been shown in small numbers of patients to have a favorable therapeutic index for Indian visceral leishmaniasis. We performed a clinical trial in India comparing miltefosine with the most effective standard treatment, amphotericin B. METHODS: The study was a randomized, open-label comparison, in which 299 patients 12 years of age or older received orally administered miltefosine (50 or 100 mg [approximately 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight] daily for 28 days) and 99 patients received intravenously administered amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram every other day for a total of 15 injections). RESULTS: The groups were well matched in terms of age, weight, proportion with previous failure of treatment for leishmaniasis, parasitologic grade of splenic aspirate, and splenomegaly. At the end of treatment, splenic aspirates were obtained from 293 patients in the miltefosine group and 98 patients in the amphotericin B group. No parasites were identified, for an initial cure rate of 100 percent. By six months after the completion of treatment, 282 of the 299 patients in the miltefosine group (94 percent [95 percent confidence interval, 91 to 97]) and 96 of the 99 patients in the amphotericin B group (97 percent) had not had a relapse; these patients were classified as cured. Vomiting and diarrhea, generally lasting one to two days, occurred in 38 percent and 20 percent of the patients in the miltefosine group, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Oral miltefosine is an effective and safe treatment for Indian visceral leishmaniasis. Miltefosine may be particularly advantageous because it can be administered orally. It may also be helpful in regions where parasites are resistant to current agents.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22016502},
	doi = {10.1093/cid/cir674},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Due to unacceptably high mortality with pentavalent antimonials, Médecins Sans Frontières in 2006 began using liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients in Ethiopia who were severely ill or positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).


METHODS

We used clinical data obtained from January 2007 to January 2009 to compare outcomes by HIV status and VL episode (primary vs relapse) and to identify risk factors for treatment failure among patients treated with AmBisome monotherapy at a total dose of 30 mg/kg in 6 doses on alternate days, a higher dose than recommended by the World Health Organization (20 mg/kg).


RESULTS

Among 94 HIV-negative severely ill VL patients, 93\% had initial cure and 6\% died. Among 195 HIV-positive patients (116 primary, 79 relapse VL), 60\% had initial cure, 7\% died, and 32\% were parasitological failures. AmBisome was less effective in the 79 HIV-positive VL relapse patients (38\% initial cure, 5\% mortality, 56\% parasitological failure) than in the 116 HIV-positive primary VL patients (74\% initial cure, 8\% mortality, 16\% parasitological failure). Sodium stibogluconate (SSG) rescue treatment increased the overall cure rate among all HIV-positive VL patients from 60\% to 83\%, but 16\% (9 of 59) of rescue treatment patients died, mainly due to SSG toxicity.


CONCLUSIONS

High-dose AmBisome for VL is safe and effective in severely ill HIV-negative patients, and safe but less effective in HIV-positive patients. Combining AmBisome with another drug may enhance its effectiveness in HIV-positive VL patients. SSG should be avoided for treatment of VL in HIV-positive patients.},

Against the axenically grown epimastigote form of the parasite, the IC50s after 120 h for ET-18-OCH3, miltefosine and ilmofosine were 3, 1 and 3 μM, respectively; at higher concentrations immediate lytic effects were observed. Eradication of the intracellular amastigote, grown inside Vero cells, was achieved at 0.1, 0.1 and 1 μM for ET-18-OCH3, miltefosine and ilmofosine, respectively. Analysis of the lipid composition of epimastigotes exposed to LPAs at their IC50 for 120 h showed that the ratio of phosphatidyl-choline (PC) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) changed from 1.5 in control cells to c. 0.67 in those treated with the analogues. A significant increase in the content of phosphatidylserine was also observed in treated cells. Intact epimastigotes efficiently incorporated radioactivity from l-[methyl-14C]methionine into PC, but not from [methyl-14C]choline. ET-18-OCH3 inhibited the incorporation of l-[methyl-14C]methionine into PC with an IC50 of 2 μM, suggesting that inhibition of the de novo synthesis through the Greenberg's pathway was a primary effect underlying the selective anti-parasitic activity of this compound. Antiproliferative synergism was observed as a consequence of combined treatment of epimastigotes with ET-18-OCH3 and ketoconazole, a sterol biosynthesis inhibitor, probably due to the fact that a secondary effect of the latter is also a blockade of PC synthesis at the level of PE-PC-N-methyl-transferase.},

Liposomes composed of HePC/egg phosphatidylcholine/stearylamine (HePC/EPC/SA) 10:10:0.1 (molar ratio) (1) and EPC/SA 10:0.1 (molar ratio) (2) were prepared and doxorubicin was encapsulated using the pH gradient method. Determination of lipids and doxorubicin has been achieved by high-performance thin-layer chromatography coupled with a flame-ionization detector. Prepared liposomes were characterized for their size distribution and their zeta-potential at each step of the preparation procedure. In vitro release studies have been evaluated in buffer and culture medium at 25 and 37 degrees C for 24 hours period. Liposomal formulations, free doxorubicin and HePC were tested against cancer cell lines and PBMCs, using sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Doxorubicin was encapsulated into the liposomes 1 and 2 at a drug to lipid molar ratio of 1.08 and 0.77, respectively, with an entrapping efficiency almost 100\% in both cases. Doxorubicin was retained into liposome 1 up to 70\% at 25 degrees C in TES, while up to 80\% was released from 1 when liposomes were incubated at 37 degrees C either in culture medium or in the TES buffer at 24 hours. The activity of doxorubicin was retained or slightly improved when entrapped into liposomes 1 and 2, while liposomal formulation 1 encapsulating doxorubicin was found to be less toxic against normal cells (PBMCs). The combination of HePC and doxorubicin in one combined formulations justified as an improvement of the therapeutic index (TI) of doxorubicin in terms of efficacy and toxicity.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Model evaluation is an important issue in population analyses. We aimed to perform a systematic review of all population PK and/or PD analyses published between 2002 and 2004 to survey the current methods used to evaluate a model and to assess whether those models were adequately evaluated.

Methods
We selected 324 papers in MEDLINE using defined keywords and built a data abstraction form (DAF) composed of a checklist of items to extract the relevant information from these articles with respect to model evaluation. In the DAF, evaluation methods were divided into 3 subsections: basic internal methods (goodness-of-fit plots [GOF], uncertainty in parameter estimates and model sensitivity), advanced internal methods (data splitting, resampling techniques and Monte Carlo simulations) and external model evaluation.

Results
Basic internal evaluation was the most frequently described method in the reports: 65\% of the models involved GOF evaluation. Standard errors or confidence intervals were reported for 50\% of fixed effects but only 22\% of random effects. Advanced internal methods were used in approximately 25\% of models: data splitting was more often used than bootstrap and cross-validation; simulations were used in 6\% of models to evaluate models by visual predictive check or by posterior predictive check. External evaluation was performed in only 7\% of models.

Conclusions
Using the subjective synthesis of model evaluation for each paper, we judged models to be adequately evaluated in 28\% of PK models and 26\% of PD models. Basic internal evaluation was preferred to more advanced methods, probably because the former are performed easily with most software. We also noticed that when the aim of modelling was predictive, advanced internal methods or more stringent methods were more often used.},

	abstract = {Obligate intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania specifically target host phagocytes for survival and replication. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ), a member of the class I PI3Ks that is highly expressed by leukocytes, controls cell migration by initiating actin polymerization and cytoskeletal reorganization, which are processes also critical for phagocytosis. In this study, we demonstrate that class IB PI3K, PI3Kγ, plays a critical role in pathogenesis of chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. mexicana. Using the isoform-selective PI3Kγ inhibitor, AS-605240 and PI3Kγ gene-deficient mice, we show that selective blockade or deficiency of PI3Kγ significantly enhances resistance against L. mexicana that is associated with a significant suppression of parasite entry into phagocytes and reduction in recruitment of host phagocytes as well as regulatory T cells to the site of infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AS-605240 is as effective as the standard antileishmanial drug sodium stibogluconate in treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. mexicana. These findings reveal a unique role for PI3Kγ in Leishmania invasion and establishment of chronic infection, and demonstrate that therapeutic targeting of host pathways involved in establishment of infection may be a viable strategy for treating infections caused by obligate intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania.},

RESULTS: The initial cure rate was 88\% in both treatment groups. Mortality during treatment was 2\% in the miltefosine group, compared with 10\% in the SSG group. Initial treatment failure was 8\% in the miltefosine group, compared with 1\% in the SSG group. Among the 375 patients (65\%) who agreed to HIV testing, HIV seroprevalence was 29\%. Among patients not infected with HIV, initial cure, mortality, and initial treatment failure rates were not significantly different (94\% vs. 95\%, 1\% vs. 3\%, and 5\% vs. 1\% for the miltefosine and SSG groups, respectively). Initial treatment failure with miltefosine occurred in 18\% of HIV-coinfected patients, compared with treatment failure in 5\% of non-HIV-infected patients. At 6 months after treatment, 174 (60\%) of the 290 miltefosine recipients and 189 (65\%) of the 290 SSG recipients experienced cure; 30 (10\%) of 290 in the miltefosine group and 7 (2\%) of 290 in the SSG group experienced relapse, and the mortality rate was 6\% in the miltefosine group, compared with 12\% in the SSG group. HIV-infected patients had higher rates of relapse (16 [25\%] of 63 patients), compared with non-HIV-infected patients (5 [5\%] of 131). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with miltefosine is equally effective as standard SSG treatment in non-HIV-infected men with VL. Among HIV-coinfected patients, miltefosine is safer but less effective than SSG.},

Both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs can be associated with liposomes and special techniques have been developed for the efficient loading of weak acids and weak bases into liposomes.Liposomes can function as sustained release systems for drugs and the rate of release can be manipulated. Advantage can be taken of the substantial changes in pharmacokinetics which often accompanies the association of drugs with liposomes. New formulations of liposomes, sterically stabilised with substances like surface-grafted polyethylene glycol have circulating half-lives in humans of up to 2 days. These long circulation times allow concentration of liposomal drug in regions of increased vascular permeability like solid tumours an decreased delivery of drug to normal tissues. Alterations of the biodistribution of drugs, when they are liposomes-associated, in general leads to significant overall decreases in drug toxicity but can also increase toxicity in some tissues. The use of targeting ligands to increase the selectivity of delivery of liposomal drugs to target tissues is currently under development. An understanding of how liposome association can alter drug properties can lead to their rational development in the treatment of many diseases.},

The method introduced deuterated miltefosine as an internal standard. Miltefosine was extracted from PBMC pellets by addition of 62.5\% methanol. Supernatant was collected, evaporated and reconstituted in plasma. Chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed phase C18 column and detection with a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. Miltefosine was quantified using plasma calibration standards ranging from 4 to 1000ng/mL. This method was validated with respect to its PBMC matrix effect, selectivity, recovery and stability. No matrix effect could be observed from the PBMC content (ranging from 0.17 to 26.3×10(6)PBMCs) reconstituted in plasma, as quality control samples were within 3.0\% of the nominal concentration (precision less than 7.7\%). At the lower limit of quantitation of 4 ng/mL plasma, corresponding to 0.12ng/10(6) PBMCs in a typical clinical sample, measured concentrations were within 8.6\% of the nominal value. Recovery showed to be reproducible as adding additional pre-treatment steps did not increase the recovery with more than 9\%. This method was successfully applied to measure intracellular miltefosine concentrations in PBMC samples from six cutaneous leishmaniasis patients up to one month post-treatment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Improved treatment approaches are needed for visceral leishmaniasis. We assessed the efficacy and safety of three potential short-course combination treatments compared with the standard monotherapy in India.


METHODS

Standard treatment (1 mg/kg amphotericin B infusion on alternate days for 30 days, total dose 15 mg/kg) was compared with three drug combinations (single injection of 5 mg/kg liposomal amphotericin B and 7-day 50 mg oral miltefosine or single 10-day 11 mg/kg intramuscular paromomycin; or 10 days each of miltefosine and paromomycin) in an open-label, parallel-group, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial in two hospital sites in Bihar, India. Patients aged 5-60 years with parasitologically confirmed visceral leishmaniasis were randomly assigned one of the four treatments by the trial statistician by use of a computer-generated list. Clinical assessments were done at the end of treatment (15 days on combination treatment; 31 days for standard treatment) and after 45 days and 6 months. The primary endpoint was definitive cure (defined as no sign or symptom of visceral leishmaniasis and parasitologically cured to the last follow-up). Analyses were done both by intention to treat and per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00696969.


FINDINGS

Between June, 2008, and July, 2009, 634 patients were assigned amphotericin B (n=157), liposomal amphotericin B with miltefosine (n=160) or paromomycin (n=158), or miltefosine and paromomycin (n=159). 618 patients were in the per-protocol population. There were two relapses in each group. The numbers with definitive cure at 6 months for the intention-to-treat population were 146 (cure rate 93·0\%; CI 87·5-96·3) for amphotericin B, 156 (97·5\%; 93·3-99·2) for liposomal amphotericin B and miltefosine, 154 (97·5\%; 93·24-99·2) for liposomal amphotericin B and paromomycin, and 157 (98·7\%; 95·1-99·8) for miltefosine and paromomycin. All combinations were non-inferior to the standard treatment, in both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. Patients in the combination groups had fewer adverse events than did those assigned standard treatment.


INTERPRETATION

Combination treatments for visceral leishmaniasis are efficacious and safe, and decrease the duration of therapy, thereby encouraging adherence and reducing emergence of drug-resistant parasites.

Persons with visceral leishmaniasis sustained 8- to 10-fold more circulating sIL-4R compared with Papua New Guinea residents with documented filariasis or uninfected Kenyan and North American subjects. Soluble IL-2R concentrations were elevated nonspecifically in both visceral leishmaniasis and filariasis patients. These findings are significant given that IL-4 induces sIL-4R in mice, and treatment with recombinant sIL-4R cures progressive murine leishmaniasis dependent on IL-4 bioactivity. Further studies are indicated to determine whether the immunologic detection of IL-4 produced in human visceral leishmaniasis is obscured because of sequestration by soluble receptor and whether the production of sIL-4R is relevant to the pathogenesis of visceral leishmaniasis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fexinidazole is a 5-nitroimidazole recently included in a clinical efficacy trial as an oral drug for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). Preclinical studies showed it acts as a pharmacologically active pro-drug with two key active metabolites: sulfoxide and sulfone (the most active metabolite). The present studies aimed to determine the best dose regimen for the treatment of stage 2 sleeping sickness patients, which could eventually also treat stage 1 patients.
METHODS: Fexinidazole was assessed in 154 healthy adult male subjects of sub-Saharan African origin. Three initial first-in-human studies and two additional studies assessed a single ascending dose and multiple ascending doses (both under fasted conditions), tablet versus suspension formulation and food effect (fasted vs. high-fat meal and field-adapted food), and multiple ascending doses with a loading dose regimen under fed conditions.
RESULTS: Fexinidazole was well-tolerated in a single dose from 100 to 3,600 mg, with quick absorption of the parent drug and rapid metabolism into sulfoxide [time to maximum concentration (t max) 2-5 h] and sulfone (t max 18-24 h). The tablet formulation was approximately 25 \% less bioavailable than the suspension, and food intake increased drug absorption and plasma concentrations of fexinidazole and its two metabolites by approximately 200 \%. Fourteen-day multiple ascending dosing administered up to 3,600 mg/day in fasted conditions showed that fexinidazole was generally well-tolerated (mild to moderate, spontaneously reversible drug-related adverse events). Following the high-fat food effect finding, another study was conducted to evaluate the impact of a low-fat regimen closer to that of the target population, showing that the type of meal does not influence fexinidazole absorption. The last study showed that a loading dose of 1,800 mg/day for 4 days followed by a 1,200 mg/day regimen for 6 days with a normal meal provided the desired exposure of fexinidazole and its metabolites, particularly sulfone, with good tolerability. Based on preclinical evidence from a chronic infection mouse model, systemic drug concentrations obtained are expected to be clinically effective in stage 2 HAT.
CONCLUSIONS: These studies show that fexinidazole can be safely assessed in patients as a potential oral cure for both stages of HAT.},

The glycolytic phenotype in cancer appears to be the common denominator of diverse molecular abnormalities in cancer and may be associated with a (potentially reversible) suppression of mitochondrial function. The generic drug dichloroacetate is an orally available small molecule that, by inhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, increases the flux of pyruvate into the mitochondria, promoting glucose oxidation over glycolysis. This reverses the suppressed mitochondrial apoptosis in cancer and results in suppression of tumour growth in vitro and in vivo. Here, we review the scientific and clinical rationale supporting the rapid translation of this promising metabolic modulator in early-phase cancer clinical trials.},

Administration of anthracyclines prior to trastuzumab increases risk of cardiotoxicity. High-sensitive troponin T and N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are molecular markers that may allow earlier detection of drug-induced cardiotoxicity. In this analysis we aimed to quantify the kinetics and exposure-response relationships of LVEF, troponin T and NT-proBNP measurements, in patients receiving anthracycline and trastuzumab. Repeated measurements of LVEF, troponin T and NT-proBNP and dosing records of anthracyclines and trastuzumab were available from a previously published clinical trial. This trial included 206 evaluable patients with early breast cancer. Exposure to anthracycline and trastuzumab was simulated based on available dosing records and by using a kinetic-pharmacodynamic (K-PD) and a fixed pharmacokinetic (PK) model from literature, respectively. The change from baseline troponin T was described with a direct effect model, affected by simulated anthracycline concentrations, representing myocyte damage. The relationship between trastuzumab and LVEF was described by an indirect effect compartment model. The EC50 for LVEF decline was significantly affected by the maximum troponin T concentration after anthracycline treatment, explaining 15.1\% of inter-individual variability. In this cohort, NT-proBNP changes could not be demonstrated to be related to anthracycline or trastuzumab treatment. Pharmacodynamic models for troponin T and LVEF were successfully developed, identifying maximum troponin T concentration after anthracycline treatment as a significant determinant for trastuzumab-induced LVEF decline. These models can help identify patients at risk of drug-induced cardiotoxicity and optimize cardiac monitoring strategies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES

This meta-analysis was performed to determine whether corticosteroid therapy induces the development of peptic ulcer and other putative complications of steroid therapy.


DESIGN

A retrospective investigation in which we analysed all the randomized, double-blind, controlled trials (RDBCT) in which steroids had been administered that we were able to identify. The number of episodes of peptic ulcer, dermatological effects, sepsis, diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, psychosis and tuberculosis reported in both the placebo and steroid groups were compared.


SETTING

The international medical literature was analysed for any RDBCT in which any steroid or ACTH had been administered in any dosage for any duration, and any putative complication of steroid therapy was reported.


SUBJECTS

Of 1857 articles, 93 satisfied our requirements and were analysed by the meta-analytic techniques of Peto, DerSimonian and Laird. A total of 6602 patients were included.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

The relative frequencies of each of these eight 'complications' were compared in the placebo and steroid groups using conventional statistics and meta-analysis. The relative frequencies of 'annualized' subgroups of patients who received treatment for 1 to 7 days, 1 week to 1 month, 1 to 3 months and more than 3 months, were similarly analysed.


RESULTS

Nine of 3267 patients in the placebo group (0.3\%) and 13 of 3335 patients in the steroid group (0.4\%) were reported to develop peptic ulcer (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The dermatological cosmetic effects of steroid therapy were observed more frequently in the steroid group (P {\textless} 0.001), as was diabetes (P {\textless} 0.001), hypertension (P {\textless} 0.01) and psychosis (P {\textless} 0.001). Sepsis, osteoporosis and tuberculosis all occurred more frequently in the steroid than in the placebo group, but the differences are not statistically significant.


CONCLUSIONS

Peptic ulcer is a rare complication of corticosteroid therapy that should not be considered a contraindication when steroid therapy is indicated.},

MIL-R was easily induced in both strains using the promastigote-stage, but a significant increase in MIL-R in the intracellular amastigote compared to the corresponding WT did not occur until promastigotes had adapted to 12.2 µM MIL. A variety of common and strain-specific genetic changes were discovered in MIL-adapted parasites, including deletions at the LdMT transporter gene, single-base mutations and changes in somy. The most obvious lipid changes in MIL-R promastigotes occurred to phosphatidylcholines and lysophosphatidylcholines and results indicate that the Kennedy pathway is involved in MIL resistance. The inherent Sb resistance of the parasite had an impact on the changes that occurred in MIL-R parasites, with more genetic changes occurring in Sb-R compared to Sb-S parasites. Initial interpretation of the changes identified in this study does not support synergies with Sb-R in the mechanisms of MIL resistance, though this requires an enhanced understanding of the parasite's biochemical pathways and how they are genetically regulated to be verified fully.

	abstract = {Governed by parasite and host factors and immunoinflammatory responses, the clinical spectrum of leishmaniasis encompasses subclinical (inapparent), localised (skin lesions), and disseminated infection (cutaneous, mucosal, or visceral). Symptomatic disease is subacute or chronic and diverse in presentation and outcome. Clinical characteristics vary further by endemic region. Despite T-cell-dependent immune responses, which produce asymptomatic and self-healing infection, or appropriate treatment, intracellular infection is probably life-long since targeted cells (tissue macrophages) allow residual parasites to persist. There is an epidemic of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and Pakistan and of visceral infection in India and Sudan. Diagnosis relies on visualising parasites in tissue or serology; culture and detection of parasite DNA are useful in the laboratory. Pentavalent antimony is the conventional treatment; however, resistance of visceral infection in India has spawned new treatment approaches--amphotericin B and its lipid formulations, injectable paromomycin, and oral miltefosine. Despite tangible advances in diagnosis, treatment, and basic scientific research, leishmaniasis is embedded in poverty and neglected. Current obstacles to realistic prevention and proper management include inadequate vector (sandfly) control, no vaccine, and insufficient access to or impetus for developing affordable new drugs.},

In preliminary laboratory trials, using urine collected from well-defined cases and controls from Brazil, Yemen and Nepal, the test had 100\% specificity and a sensitivity between 68 and 100\%. When used in a time-course experiment in cotton rats infected with Leishmania donovani, the test became positive 1 week after inoculation and antigen levels in urine declined rapidly after chemotherapy (the test was negative before the end of the course of treatment). Finally, in an integrated study performed in Sudan, KATEX was compared to microscopy and four different serological tests in a group of 73 patients having presented with clinical manifestations suggestive of visceral leishmaniasis. Compared to microscopy, KATEX performed better than any single serological test in predicting positivity and a particularly good result was obtained by combining KATEX and the direct agglutination test (DAT).},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION

Different methods are available for diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), among them the urine-based antigen detection assay, latex agglutination test (Katex), is a recently developed one. The main drawback of the test is false-positive reactivity in some of healthy individuals. The false positivity of the test can be removed by boiling the urine sample for 5 min before testing. In this study an attempt was made to improve Katex by removing unpleasant boiling process, which also decreases field applicability of the test.


METHODS

False-positive and true-positive urine samples were collected from VL patients and healthy individuals. Both samples were then treated by reagents including, sodium dodecyl sulfate, trichloroacetic acid, dithiothreitol (DTT), sulphosalicylic acid and also heating at 56 degrees C.


RESULTS

Findings of this study showed that DTT pretreatment significantly reduced the rate of false-positive reactivity of Katex where 73\% of false-positive urine samples changed to negative after DTT treatment. However, the DTT treatment reduced the rate of true positivity by 14\%.


CONCLUSION

These data indicate that DTT can be used to eliminate nonspecific reactivity in the Katex. This will improve the performance of Katex and make it a more convenient and field applicable test.},

	abstract = {Background: Convenient, safe, and effective treatments for visceral leishmaniasis in Eastern African children are lacking. Miltefosine, the only oral treatment, failed to achieve adequate cure rates in Eastern Africa, particularly in children, in whom linear dosing (2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days) resulted in 59\% cure rate, with lower systemic miltefosine exposure than in adults.
Methods: We conducted a phase-II trial in Kenya and Uganda in 30 children, aged 4-12 years, with visceral leishmaniasis, to test whether 28 days of allometric miltefosine dosing is able to safely achieve a higher and more effective systemic exposure of miltefosine than linear dosing (historical data).
Results: Miltefosine accumulated during treatment. Median AUC0-210 and Cmax values were slightly higher than those reported previously for children on linear dosing but not dose-proportionally. Miltefosine exposure at start of treatment was increased, with higher median day-7 plasma concentrations (5.88 vs 2.67 µg/mL). Concentration-time curves were less variable, avoiding the low levels of exposure observed with linear dosing. The 210-day cure rate was 90\% (95\% confidence interval, 73\%-98\%), similar to that previously described in adults. Nineteen miltefosine-treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred but none caused treatment discontinuation. Two serious AEs occurred, both unrelated to treatment and fully recovering.
Conclusions: Allometric miltefosine dosing achieved increased and less variable exposure than linear dosing, though not reaching the expected exposure levels. The new dosing regimen safely increased the efficacy of miltefosine for Eastern African children with visceral leishmaniasis. Further development of miltefosine should adopt allometric dosing in paediatric patients.},

In addition, recent evidence suggests their involvement in the development of the immune response. The role of neutrophils during the first weeks post-infection with Leishmania donovani was investigated in this study. When L. donovani-infected mice were selectively depleted of neutrophils with the NIMP-R14 monoclonal antibody, a significant increase in parasite numbers was observed in the spleen and bone marrow and to a lesser extent in the liver. Increased susceptibility was associated with enhanced splenomegally, a delay in the maturation of hepatic granulomas, and a decrease in inducible nitric oxide synthase expression within granulomas. In the spleen, neutrophil depletion was associated with a significant increase in interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-10 levels and reduced gamma interferon secretion by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Increased production of serum IL-4 and IL-10 and higher levels of Leishmania-specific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) versus IgG2a revealed the preferential induction of Th2 responses in neutrophil-depleted mice. Altogether, these data suggest a critical role for neutrophils in the early protective response against L. donovani, both as effector cells involved in the killing of the parasites and as significant players influencing the development of a protective Th1 immune response.},

To circumvent the need for cooling systems in the field, 0.2\% (wt/vol) gelatin was added to the serum diluent instead of fetal bovine serum, with reliable results. Specificity and sensitivity were improved by the incorporation of 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol in samples with borderline titers. The test could be performed on samples of whole blood; thus the difficulties of preparation and storage of serum, plasma, or filter paper blood are avoided. For mass screening programs, a single serum dilution of 1:6,400 could be employed, contributing to a further reduction in test expenses. Sera from different geographical areas showed equal reactivities in this direct agglutination test despite the nonhomologous Leishmania donovani antigens used.},

Unresponsiveness to antimonial therapy reinforces the importance of determining parameters for treatment assessment. We analysed the pre- and post-treatment serum levels of soluble CD4 (sCD4), sCD8, sIL-2R, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and neopterin in groups of VL patients either responsive or not to standard antimonial therapy. Pretreatment serum levels of all markers except for sICAM-1 were significantly higher in VL patients than in healthy subjects from the same area (P {\textless} 0.05). sICAM-1 levels were similar in healthy controls and in VL patients refractory to antimonial therapy (P = 0.25), but significantly higher in patients responsive to treatment (P = 0.02). The comparison of pre- and post-treatment concentrations showed that all markers, except sCD4 and sICAM-1, presented a significant fall (P {\textless} 0.05) in patients responsive to antimonial therapy. However, only neopterin presented with levels compatible with those of healthy subjects at the end of treatment (P = 0.30). In refractory patients sICAM-1 presented with post-treatment levels significantly higher than the pretreatment determinations (P = 0.03), while sCD4 experienced a significant drop (P = 0.01). All markers displayed clearly distinct behaviour according to the patient's response to therapy. This makes all soluble molecules studied suitable for use as indicators of antimonial therapy response. Additionally the comparison of pretreatment levels of the markers between responders and refractory patients to antimonial therapy showed that serum concentrations of sIL-2R and sICAM-1 significantly differed among these two groups (P = 0.02 in each case), suggesting that they may be used in future as predictors of antimonial therapy response.},

Six drugs (benzylpenicillin, cefuroxime, erythromycin, gentamicin, moxifloxacin, and vancomycin), representing a broad selection of mechanisms of action and PK and PD characteristics, were investigated. For each drug, a dose fractionation study was simulated, using a wide range of total daily doses given as intermittent doses (dosing intervals of 4, 8, 12, or 24 h) or as a constant drug exposure. The time course of the drug concentration (PK model) as well as the bacterial response to drug exposure (in vitro PKPD model) was predicted. Nonlinear least-squares regression analyses determined the PK/PD index (the maximal unbound drug concentration [fC(max)]/MIC, the area under the unbound drug concentration-time curve [fAUC]/MIC, or the percentage of a 24-h time period that the unbound drug concentration exceeds the MIC [fT({\textgreater}MIC)]) that was most predictive of the effect. The in silico predictions based on the in vitro PKPD model identified the previously determined PK/PD indices, with fT({\textgreater}MIC) being the best predictor of the effect for β-lactams and fAUC/MIC being the best predictor for the four remaining evaluated drugs. The selection and magnitude of the PK/PD index were, however, shown to be sensitive to differences in PK in subpopulations, uncertainty in MICs, and investigated dosing intervals. In comparison with the use of the PK/PD indices, a model-based approach, where the full time course of effect can be predicted, has a lower sensitivity to study design and allows for PK differences in subpopulations to be considered directly. This study supports the use of PKPD models built from in vitro time-kill curves in the development of optimal dosing regimens for antibacterial drugs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lean bodyweight (LBW) has been recommended for scaling drug doses. However, the current methods for predicting LBW are inconsistent at extremes of size and could be misleading with respect to interpreting weight-based regimens. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to develop a semi-mechanistic model to predict fat-free mass (FFM) from subject characteristics in a population that includes extremes of size. FFM is considered to closely approximate LBW. There are several reference methods for assessing FFM, whereas there are no reference standards for LBW. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 373 patients (168 male, 205 female) were included in the study. These data arose from two populations. Population A (index dataset) contained anthropometric characteristics, FFM estimated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA - a reference method) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) data. Population B (test dataset) contained the same anthropometric measures and FFM data as population A, but excluded BIA data. The patients in population A had a wide range of age (18-82 years), bodyweight (40.7-216.5 kg) and BMI values (17.1-69.9 kg/m2). Patients in population B had BMI values of 18.7-38.4 kg/m2. A two-stage semi-mechanistic model to predict FFM was developed from the demographics from population A. For stage 1 a model was developed to predict impedance and for stage 2 a model that incorporated predicted impedance was used to predict FFM. These two models were combined to provide an overall model to predict FFM from patient characteristics. The developed model for FFM was externally evaluated by predicting into population B. RESULTS: The semi-mechanistic model to predict impedance incorporated sex, height and bodyweight. The developed model provides a good predictor of impedance for both males and females (r2 = 0.78, mean error [ME] = 2.30 x 10(-3), root mean square error [RMSE] = 51.56 [approximately 10\% of mean]). The final model for FFM incorporated sex, height and bodyweight. The developed model for FFM provided good predictive performance for both males and females (r2 = 0.93, ME = -0.77, RMSE = 3.33 [approximately 6\% of mean]). In addition, the model accurately predicted the FFM of subjects in population B (r2 = 0.85, ME = -0.04, RMSE = 4.39 [approximately 7\% of mean]). CONCLUSIONS: A semi-mechanistic model has been developed to predict FFM (and therefore LBW) from easily accessible patient characteristics. This model has been prospectively evaluated and shown to have good predictive performance.},

However, the effect of pregnancy-related changes on exposure is unclear, and pregnancy has been associated with decreased efficacy in previous studies. This study aimed to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of artemether, its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin, and lumefantrine in 22 Rwandese pregnant women in their second (n = 11) or third (n = 11) trimester with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. These patients were enrolled from Rwamagana district hospital and received the standard fixed oral dose combination of 80 mg of artemether and 480 mg of lumefantrine twice daily for 3 days. Venous plasma concentrations were quantified for all three analytes using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectroscopy, and data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Lumefantrine pharmacokinetics was described by a flexible but highly variable absorption, with a mean absorption time of 4.04 h, followed by a biphasic disposition model. The median area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC0-∞) for lumefantrine was 641 h · mg/liter. Model-based simulations indicated that 11.7\% of the study population did not attain the target day 7 plasma concentration (280 ng/ml), a threshold associated with increased risk of recrudescence. The pharmacokinetics of artemether was time dependent, and the autoinduction of its clearance was described using an enzyme turnover model. The turnover half-life was predicted to be 30.4 h. The typical oral clearance, which started at 467 liters/h, increased 1.43-fold at the end of treatment. Simulations suggested that lumefantrine pharmacokinetic target attainment appeared to be reassuring in Rwandese pregnant women, particularly compared to target attainment in Southeast Asia. Larger cohorts will be required to confirm this finding.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a semimechanistic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model describing chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression through drug-specific parameters and system-related parameters, which are common to all drugs.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient leukocyte and neutrophil data after administration of docetaxel, paclitaxel, and etoposide were used to develop the model, which was also applied to myelosuppression data from 2′-deoxy-2′-methylidenecytidine (DMDC), irinotecan (CPT-11), and vinflunine administrations. The model consisted of a proliferating compartment that was sensitive to drugs, three transit compartments that represented maturation, and a compartment of circulating blood cells. Three system-related parameters were estimated: baseline, mean transit time, and a feedback parameter. Drug concentration-time profiles affected the proliferation of sensitive cells by either an inhibitory linear model or an inhibitory Emax model. To evaluate the model, system-related parameters were fixed to the same values for all drugs, which were based on the results from the estimations, and only drug-specific parameters were estimated. All modeling was performed using NONMEM software.
RESULTS: For all investigated drugs, the model successfully described myelosuppression. Consecutive courses and different schedules of administration were also well characterized. Similar system-related parameter estimates were obtained for the different drugs and also for leukocytes compared with neutrophils. In addition, when system-related parameters were fixed, the model well characterized chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression for the different drugs.
CONCLUSION: This model predicted myelosuppression after administration of one of several different chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, with fixed system-related parameters to proposed values, and only drug-related parameters estimated, myelosuppression can be predicted. We propose that this model can be a useful tool in the development of anticancer drugs and therapies.},

Ours results show that arginase I is induced in both susceptible and resistant mice during the development of the disease. However, in BALB/c-infected tissues, the induction of this protein parallels the time of infection, while in C57BL/6 mice, the enzyme is upregulated only during footpad swelling. The induction of the host arginase in both strains is mediated by the balance between interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-12 and opposite to nitric oxide synthase II expression. Moreover, inhibition of arginase reduces the number of parasites and delays disease outcome in BALB/c mice, while treatment with l-ornithine increases the susceptibility of C57BL/6 mice. Therefore, arginase I induction could be considered a marker of disease in leishmaniasis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an endemic disease in some parts of Iran. Many techniques have been used for diagnosis of VL, among which the urine based latex agglutination test (KAtex) is a promising one.


OBJECTIVE

To compare three diagnostic tests of VL including KAtex, ELISA and Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) in VL patients and healthy controls in the south west of Iran.


METHODS

Serum (n = 29) and urine samples (n = 31) were collected from parasitologically confirmed VL patients. Control samples were obtained from healthy individuals (n = 61) and also from patients with infectious diseases other than VL. The collected serum samples were tested by DAT and ELISA using crude antigen from promastigotes of Leishmania infantum and the urine samples were tested by KAtex.


RESULTS

Sensitivity and specificity of KAtex for diagnosis of VL was found to be 83.9\% and 100\%, respectively. Sensitivities of DAT and ELISA were 93.1\% and 86.2\% and their specificities were 100\% and 90.5\%, respectively.


CONCLUSION

KAtex yielded a satisfactory sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of VL in Iran and can be recommended as a rapid, field applicable and reliable test for diagnosis of VL in this region.},

The nanoparticles prepared by nanoprecipitation method were in nanometer size range with high entrapment efficiency and positive surface charge. In-vitro release studies indicated prolonged release of natamycin up to 8h. In-vitro antifungal activity was comparable with marketed preparation. The performance of nanoformulations was evaluated in rabbit eyes. The concentration of natamycin in tear fluid was determined by using LC-MS/MS. The pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the curve, t½ and mean residence time were significantly higher and clearance was significantly lower for nanoformulations with that of marketed preparation. The optimized dosing schedule to maintain natamycin concentration above tenfold of MIC90 was one instillation in every 5h. Moreover, 1/5th dose reduction of nanoformulation was also effective.},

	abstract = {The control of the protozoan parasite Leishmania relies on few drugs with unknown cellular targets and unclear mode of action. Several antileishmanials, however, were shown to induce apoptosis in Leishmania and this death mechanism was further studied in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Leishmania infantum. In sensitive parasites, antimonials (SbIII), miltefosine (MF) and amphotericin B (AMB), but not paromomycin (PARO), triggered apoptotic cell death associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS). In contrast, Leishmania mutants resistant to SbIII, MF or AMB not only failed to undergo apoptosis following exposure to their respective drugs, but also were more tolerant towards apoptosis induced by other antileishmanials, provided that these killed Leishmania via ROS production. Such tolerance favored the rapid acquisition of multidrug resistance. PARO killed Leishmania in a non-apoptotic manner and failed to produce ROS. PARO resistance neither protected against drug-induced apoptosis nor provided an increased rate of acquisition of resistance to other antileishmanials. However, the PARO-resistant mutant, but not SbIII-, MF- or AMB-resistant mutants, became rapidly cross-resistant to methotrexate, a model drug also not producing ROS. Our results therefore link the mode of killing of drugs to tolerance to cell death and to a facilitated emergence of multidrug resistance. These findings may have fundamental implications in the field of chemotherapeutic interventions.},

Although it is licensed for use in eastern Africa, in practice it is mainly used as a second-line treatment. A small study carried out in Kenya indicated that a higher dose is necessary in eastern Africa in contrast to Asia. This study aimed to determine the minimum single dose that is safe and effective for treatment of eastern African VL patients so as to be used in simplified treatment regimens. However, the tested regimens were found to be ineffective, and an optimal single dose that could potentially be used in simplified treatment regimens was not identified.},

We aimed to characterize the in vitro antimony susceptibility of clinical isolates of Nepalese VL patients, and to correlate this in vitro parasite phenotype to clinical therapy outcome. Thirty-three clinical isolates of L. donovani were taken from patients with known disease history. These isolates were typed and the susceptibility of intracellular amastigotes to pentavalent (SbV) and trivalent (SbIII) antimonials was determined. We observed (i) 22 SbV-resistant isolates out of 33 tested and (ii) 3 SbIII-resistant isolates out of 12 tested. Amongst the latter, there were three combinations of in vitro phenotypes: (i) parasites sensitive (n=4) or (ii) resistant to both drugs (n=3) and (iii) resistant to SbV only (n=5). There was no geographical clustering in terms of in vitro susceptibility. The relation between the in vitro susceptibility to antimonials and the corresponding in vivo treatment outcome was ambiguous. Our results highlight the need to adjust the currently used Leishmania drug susceptibility assays if they are to be used for prognosis of in vivo SSG treatment outcome.},

This article provides working definitions and a conceptual framework to understand the roles of biomarkers in clinical research.

Recent findings
The definitions of the terms discussed in this article—medical signs, symptoms, biomarkers, surrogate endpoints, clinical endpoints, validation—are still under discussion, as are their relationships to each other, but broad consensus has developed in the past decade and a half about the necessity of distinguishing between, in particular, surrogate and clinical endpoints.

Summary
This article outlines the major definitions of the key terms in this field and considers select cases where misunderstandings about the terms led to flawed research conclusions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Unlike CD4+ T cells, HIV-1 infected macrophages exhibit extended life span even upon stress, consistent with their in vivo role as long-lived HIV-1 reservoirs.


RESULTS

Here, we demonstrate that PI3K/Akt inhibitors, including clinically available Miltefosine, dramatically reduced HIV-1 production from long-living virus-infected macrophages. These PI3K/Akt inhibitors hyper-sensitize infected macrophages to extracellular stresses that they are normally exposed to, and eventually lead to cell death of infected macrophages without harming uninfected cells. Based on the data from these Akt inhibitors, we were able to further investigate how HIV-1 infection utilizes the PI3K/Akt pathway to establish the cytoprotective effect of HIV-1 infection, which extends the lifespan of infected macrophages, a key viral reservoir. First, we found that HIV-1 infection activates the well characterized pro-survival PI3K/Akt pathway in primary human macrophages, as reflected by decreased PTEN protein expression and increased Akt kinase activity. Interestingly, the expression of HIV-1 or SIV Tat is sufficient to mediate this cytoprotective effect, which is dependent on the basic domain of Tat - a region that has previously been shown to bind p53. Next, we observed that this interaction appears to contribute to the downregulation of PTEN expression, since HIV-1 Tat was found to compete with PTEN for p53 binding; this is known to result in p53 destabilization, with a consequent reduction in PTEN protein production.


CONCLUSION

Since HIV-1 infected macrophages display highly elevated Akt activity, our results collectively show that PI3K/Akt inhibitors may be a novel therapy for interfering with the establishment of long-living HIV-1 infected reservoirs.},

	abstract = {The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in leishmaniasis patients are, to a great extent, unknown. We examined and characterized the pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in a group of patients with Old World (Leishmania major) cutaneous leishmaniasis. Miltefosine plasma concentrations were determined in samples taken during and up to 5 months after the end of treatment from 31 Dutch military personnel who contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and were treated with 150 mg miltefosine/day for 28 days. Samples were analyzed with a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 4 ng/ml. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed with nonlinear mixed-effect modeling, using NONMEM. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine could best be described by an open two-compartment disposition model, with a first elimination half-life of 7.05 days and a terminal elimination half-life of 30.9 days. The median concentration in the last week of treatment (days 22 to 28) was 30,800 ng/ml. The maximum duration of follow-up was 202 days after the start of treatment. All analyzed samples contained a concentration above the LLOQ. Miltefosine is eliminated from the body much slower than previously thought and is therefore still detectable in human plasma samples taken 5 to 6 months after the end of treatment. The presence of subtherapeutic miltefosine concentrations in the blood beyond 5 months after treatment might contribute to the selection of resistant parasites, and moreover, the measures for preventing the teratogenic risks of miltefosine treatment should be reconsidered.},

	abstract = {Experimental visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by infection with Leishmania donovani results in the development of organ-specific immunity in the two main target tissues of infection, the spleen and the liver. The liver is the site of an acute resolving infection associated with the development of inflammatory granulomas around infected Kupffer cells, and resistance to reinfection. Paradoxically, the spleen is an initial site for the generation of cell-mediated immune responses, but ultimately becomes a site of parasite persistence with associated immunopathological changes. These include splenomegaly and a breakdown in tissue architecture that is postulated to contribute to the immunocompromized status of the host. The progressive development of splenic pathology is largely associated with high levels of TNF and interleukin (IL)-10. Follicular dendritic cell (DC) networks are lost, whereas TNF mediates the destruction of marginal zone macrophages and gp38+ stromal cells, and IL-10 promotes impaired DC migration into T-cell areas with consequent ineffective T-cell priming. Splenic stromal cell function is also altered, promoting the selective development of IL-10-producing DC with immunoregulatory properties. Ultimately, a fine immunological balance determines responses that effectively promote parasite clearance in the liver and those that promote pathology in the spleen, and future investigation aims to separate these responses to offer further means of parasite control in chronically infected VL patients.},

One hundred twenty-one patients were not assessable. With the conservative assumption that all low hemoglobin values represented treatment failure, the final per protocol cure rate was 85\%. Of 13 severe adverse events, 6 led to treatment discontinuation and 7 resulted in deaths, but only 1 death (associated with diarrhea) could be attributed to drug. Nearly all non-serious adverse events were gastrointestinal: vomiting in 25\% of patients and diarrhea in 8\% of patients.

We reviewed the evidence and potential for combination therapy, and the criteria for the choice of drugs in such regimens. The first phase 2 results of combination regimens are promising, and have identified effective and safe regimens as short as 8 days. Several phase 3 trials are underway or planned in the Indian subcontinent and east Africa. The limited data available suggest that combination therapy is more cost-effective and reduces indirect costs for patients. Additional advantages are reduced treatment duration (8-17 days), with potentially better patient compliance and lesser burden on the health system. Only limited data are available on how best to prevent acquired resistance. Patients who are coinfected with visceral leishmaniasis and HIV could be a reservoir for development and spread of drug-resistant strains, calling for special precautions. The identification of a short, cheap, well-tolerated combination regimen that can be given in ambulatory care and needs minimal clinical monitoring will most likely have important public health implications. Effective monitoring systems and close regulations and policy will be needed to ensure effective implementation. Whether combination therapy could indeed help delay resistance, and how this is best achieved, will only be known in the long term.},

Injection of 200 microl of plasma extracts onto a 100x3 mm normal-phase analytical column at a flow-rate of 0.5 ml/min provided retention-times of 2.4 and 2.1 min for perifosine (I) and the internal standard (II), respectively. The standard curves were linear from 4 to 2000 ng/ml using weighted linear regression analysis (1/Y2). The inter-assay and intra-assay accuracies for the calibration standards were within +0.9\% and -0.2\%, exhibiting precisions (C.V.) of +/-6.5 and +/-7.3\%, respectively. Up to 100 unknowns may be analysed each 24 h per analyst.},

	abstract = {Nitrate levels were measured in serum and in organs from Lshs BALB/c and Lshr C3H/HeN mice during the acute phase (30 d) of infection by Leishmania donovani strain LV9. Serum nitrate levels increased rapidly in BALB/c mice from a baseline level (17 +/- 4 mumol/L) to a plateau (504 +/- 129 mumol/L) at 24 d and correlated with parasite loads in the liver (r = 0.817, P {\textless} 0.01) and in the spleen (r = 0.854, P {\textless} 0.001). Liver and spleen nitrate contents were enhanced 2.7-fold and 22.8-fold, respectively, with respect to uninfected controls (2692 +/- 249 vs. 992 +/- 231 nmol, P {\textless} 0.02 and 20 +/- 1 vs. 456 +/- 43 nmol, P {\textless} 0.02). In contrast, serum nitrate increased to a lesser extent in C3H/HeN mice, from 31 +/- 5 mumol/L to 86 +/- 5 mumol/L at 20 d. Liver nitrate content did not differ significantly between infected and control mice (1093 +/- 83 vs. 867 +/- 104 nmol), whereas the former had a higher spleen nitrate content (145 +/- 22 vs. 40 +/- 2 nmol, P {\textless} 0.02). Our findings indicate that production of NO by the susceptible BALB/c strain exceeded that of the resistant C3H/HeN strain during the acute stage of infection by L. donovani. Tissue NO overproduction in organs infected by L. donovani was related to the progression of parasitic disease and contributed to high nitrate serum levels. It would be very interesting to extend this investigation to human disease with the aim of evaluating serum nitrate as a marker of parasite load in the follow-up of patients suffering from visceral leishmaniasis.},

	abstract = {Pharmacokinetic data consist of drug concentration measurements, as well as reports of some measured concentrations being below the quantification limit of the assay (BQL). A pharmacokinetic model may befit to these data, and for this purpose, the BQL observations must be either discarded or handled in a special way. In this paper, seven methods for dealing with BQL observations are evaluated. Both single-subject and population data are simulated from a one-compartment model. A moderate amount of data is simulated for each individual. The actual cv of concentration measurements at the quantification limit is assumed to be no greater than 20\%, in accord with the FDA Guidance. The results of this paper should be interpreted in this context. The methods include handling BQL observations as fixed-point censored observations, i.e., by using the likelihoods that these observations are in fact BQL. This method is shown to have some overall statistical advantage. However, the gain in using this method over that of simply discarding the BQL observations is not always much, and this is especially so when the frequency of BQL observations is small. Some simple methods entailing (i) replacing one or more BQL observations with the value 0, or (ii) replacing them with the value QL/2, where QL is the quantification limit, are also included. The first of these two approaches should not be used With population data, use of the second approach can result in some noticeably improved estimation of the typical value of a parameter, but then there is also marked degradation in the estimation of the population variance of the parameter.},

	abstract = {Deformable vesicles and traditional liposomes were compared as delivery systems for oestradiol to elucidate possible mechanisms of drug delivery through human skin. Accordingly, epidermal permeation of oestradiol from optimized deformable vesicles and traditional liposome formulations was studied under low dose non-occluded conditions. Five mechanisms were investigated. A free drug mechanism compared low-dose permeation through skin with drug release determined after separation of the free drug. Penetration enhancement was researched by studying skin pretreatment with empty vesicles. Improved drug uptake by skin was monitored by dipping stratum corneum into different formulations for 10 min and determining drug uptake. The possibility that intact vesicles permeate through the epidermis was tested by comparing permeation from 136-nm vesicles with that from {\textgreater}500-nm vesicles, assuming that penetration depends on vesicle size. The possibility that different entrapment efficiencies in alternative formulations could be responsible for the difference in delivery was also evaluated.Lipid vesicles improved the skin delivery of oestradiol compared with delivery from an aqueous control. Maximum flux (Jmax) was increased 14- to 17-fold by use of deformable vesicles and 8·2- to 9·8-fold by use of traditional liposomes. Deformable vesicles were thus superior to traditional liposomes. Drug release was negligible over the period during which skin flux was maximum. Pretreatment with empty vesicles resulted in an enhancement ratio of 4·3 for pure phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles but the enhancement ratio ranged from only 0·8 to 2·4 for other formulations. Vesicles increased drug uptake into the stratum corneum 23- to 29-fold. Relative flux values obtained from small and large vesicles were similar. No correlation was found between entrapment efficiency and skin delivery.The results showed no evidence of a free drug mechanism, but revealed a possible penetration-enhancing effect for pure PC vesicles, although this was not the only mechanism operating. The positive uptake suggested that lipid vesicles increased drug partitioning into the skin. The data provided no evidence for in-vitro liposome penetration through skin as distinct from vesicle penetration into the stratum corneum.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

There is no effective orally administered medication for any leishmania infection. We investigated miltefosine, which can be taken orally, for the treatment of Indian visceral leishmaniasis. Miltefosine is a phosphocholine analogue that affects cell-signaling pathways and membrane synthesis.


METHODS

The study was an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 trial in which four 30-person cohorts received 50, 100, or 150 mg of miltefosine per day for four or six weeks. The 120 patients, who ranged in age from 12 to 50 years, had anorexia, fever, and splenomegaly with at least moderate (2+) leishmania in a splenic aspirate. A parasitologic cure was defined by the absence of parasites in a splenic aspirate obtained two weeks after completion of treatment. The clinical response was assessed at six months.


RESULTS

In all 120 patients there was an initial parasitologic cure. Six patients had clinical and parasitologic relapses; the remaining 114 patients had not relapsed by six months after treatment, for a cure rate of 95 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 89 to 98 percent). With the regimen of 100 mg of miltefosine per day (approximately 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) for four weeks, 29 of 30 patients (97 percent) were cured. Gastrointestinal side effects were frequent (occurring in 62 percent of patients) but mild to moderate in severity, and no patient discontinued therapy because of gastrointestinal side effects. In two patients, treatment was discontinued because of elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase or creatinine; in both patients the levels rapidly returned to normal. In 12 other patients, the level of aspartate aminotransferase increased to 100 to 150 U per liter during treatment.


CONCLUSIONS

Orally administered miltefosine appears to be an effective treatment for Indian visceral leishmaniasis.},

AmB (3 mg/kg/day, intravenously [i.v.]) given for 4 days caused a significant decrease in the concentration of hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 (0.43 +/- 0.06 nmol/mg versus 0.62 +/- 0. 05 nmol/mg for the control [P {\textless} 0.05]). Following the application of Li-AMB (15 mg/kg/day, i.v.), hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 concentrations were unchanged at 0.64 +/- 0.08 nmol/mg. AmB decreased ex vivo propafenone metabolism to 5-hydroxy-propafenone and N-desalkyl-propafenone significantly. Sodium deoxycholate (the vehicle of AmB) by itself induced a significant decline of 5-hydroxy-propafenone and N-desalkyl-propafenone production, while microsomal cytochrome P-450 concentrations remained unchanged. In contrast, Li-AMB did not change the levels of production of 5-hydroxy-propafenone or of N-desalkyl-propafenone at either substrate concentration tested (50 micromol and 200 micromol). Microsomal AmB concentrations were significantly higher following Li-AMB application (21.1 +/- 6.2 microg/g versus 3.7 +/- 1.4 microg/g for AmB [P {\textless} 0.05]). We conclude that Li-AMB, in contrast to AmB, decreases neither hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 nor hepatic propafenone metabolism in rats ex vivo. Sodium deoxycholate alone decreases propafenone metabolism in a similar way to AmB, suggesting that it participates in AmB-induced disturbance of hepatic metabolic function.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 1975-99, only 1·1\% of new therapeutic products had been developed for neglected diseases. Since then, several public and private initiatives have attempted to mitigate this imbalance. We analysed the research and development pipeline of drugs and vaccines for neglected diseases from 2000 to 2011.
METHODS: We searched databases of drug regulatory authorities, WHO, and clinical trial registries for entries made between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2011. We defined neglected diseases as malaria, tuberculosis, diarrhoeal diseases, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs; WHO definition), and other diseases of poverty according to common definitions.
FINDINGS: Of the 850 new therapeutic products registered in 2000-11, 37 (4\%) were indicated for neglected diseases, comprising 25 products with a new indication or formulation and eight vaccines or biological products. Only four new chemical entities were approved for neglected diseases (three for malaria, one for diarrhoeal disease), accounting for 1\% of the 336 new chemical entities approved during the study period. Of 148,445 clinical trials registered in Dec 31, 2011, only 2016 (1\%) were for neglected diseases.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings show a persistent insufficiency in drug and vaccine development for neglected diseases. Nevertheless, these and other data show a slight improvement during the past 12 years in new therapeutics development and registration. However, for many neglected diseases, new therapeutic products urgently need to be developed and delivered to improve control and potentially achieve elimination.

There was no geographical clustering in terms of in vitro susceptibility. The relation between the in vitro susceptibility to antimonials and the corresponding in vivo treatment outcome was ambiguous.

The method introduced deuterated miltefosine as an internal standard. Miltefosine was extracted from PBMC pellets by addition of 62.5\% methanol. Supernatant was collected, evaporated and reconstituted in plasma. Chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed phase C18 column and detection with a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. Miltefosine was quantified using plasma calibration standards ranging from 4 to 1000ng/mL. This method was validated with respect to its PBMC matrix effect, selectivity, recovery and stability. No matrix effect could be observed from the PBMC content (ranging from 0.17 to 26.3×10(6)PBMCs) reconstituted in plasma, as quality control samples were within 3.0\% of the nominal concentration (precision less than 7.7\%). At the lower limit of quantitation of 4 ng/mL plasma, corresponding to 0.12ng/10(6) PBMCs in a typical clinical sample, measured concentrations were within 8.6\% of the nominal value. Recovery showed to be reproducible as adding additional pre-treatment steps did not increase the recovery with more than 9\%. This method was successfully applied to measure intracellular miltefosine concentrations in PBMC samples from six cutaneous leishmaniasis patients up to one month post-treatment.},

Hence there is a need to explore alternative treatment protocols such as miltefosine alone or in combinations including miltefosine, sodium stibogluconate (SSG) or liposomal amphotericin B. The aim of this trial is to identify regimen(s) which are sufficiently promising for future trials in East Africa.
METHODS/DESIGN: A phase II randomized, parallel arm, open-labelled trial is being conducted to assess the efficacy of each of the three regimens: liposomal amphotericin B with SSG, Liposomal amphotericin B with miltefosine and miltefosine alone. The primary endpoint is cure at day 28 with secondary endpoint at day 210 (6 months). Initial cure is a single composite measure based on parasitologic evaluation (bone marrow, spleen or lymph node aspirate) and clinical assessment. Repeated interim analyses have been planned after recruitment of 15 patients in each arm with a maximum sample size of 63 for each. These will follow group-sequential methods (the triangular test) to identify when a regimen is inadequate ({\textless}75\% efficacy) or adequate ({\textgreater}90\% efficacy). We describe a method to ensure consistency of the sequential analysis of day 28 cure with the non-sequential analysis of day 210 cure.
DISCUSSION: A regimen with adequate efficacy would be a candidate for treatment of VL with reasonable costs. The design allows repeated testing throughout the trial recruitment period while maintaining good statistical properties (Type I \& II error rates) and reducing the expected sample sizes.

	abstract = {The early eighties saw the introduction of liposomes as skin drug delivery systems, initially promoted primarily for localised effects with minimal systemic delivery. Subsequently, a novel ultradeformable vesicular system (termed "Transfersomes" by the inventors) was reported for transdermal delivery with an efficiency similar to subcutaneous injection. Further research illustrated that the mechanisms of liposome action depended on the application regime and the vesicle composition and morphology.
Ethical, health and supply problems with human skin have encouraged researchers to use skin models. Traditional models involved polymer membranes and animal tissue, but whilst of value for release studies, such models are not always good mimics for the complex human skin barrier, particularly with respect to the stratum corneal intercellular lipid domains. These lipids have a multiply bilayered organization, a composition and organization somewhat similar to liposomes. Consequently researchers have used vesicles as skin model membranes. Early work first employed phospholipid liposomes and tested their interactions with skin penetration enhancers, typically using thermal analysis and spectroscopic analyses. Another approach probed how incorporation of compounds into liposomes led to the loss of entrapped markers, analogous to "fluidization" of stratum corneum lipids on treatment with a penetration enhancer. Subsequently scientists employed liposomes formulated with skin lipids in these types of studies.
Following a brief description of the nature of the skin barrier to transdermal drug delivery and the use of liposomes in drug delivery through skin, this article critically reviews the relevance of using different types of vesicles as a model for human skin in permeation enhancement studies, concentrating primarily on liposomes after briefly surveying older models. The validity of different types of liposome is considered and traditional skin models are compared to vesicular model membranes for their precision and accuracy as skin membrane mimics.},

	abstract = {A 26-year-old man presented to our clinic for advice on treatment options regarding cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) with multiple lesions. The biopsy revealed Leishmania amastigotes; Leishmania major was identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).(11 )Leishmania serology (indirect immunofluorescence test) was positive at 1 : 160 (normal, {\textless} or = 1 : 40). Ten weeks earlier, the patient had spent a 1-week biking holiday in central Tunisia. Two weeks after returning to Germany, he noticed the flaring up of multiple insect bites ({\textgreater} 40) contracted in Tunisia on both arms. The lesions increased in size and axillary lymph node enlargement occurred. Some of the nodular lesions disappeared spontaneously and some increased in size and showed central ulceration. When we first saw the patient, he had six lesions on his right arm and one on his left arm. The largest lesion was on the dorsum of the right hand (Fig. 1) and showed an indurated edge and central ulceration. Before starting systemic treatment, the patient decided to wait a few weeks in case spontaneous improvement occurred. However, 8 weeks later, the ulceration had further increased in size (Fig. 2) from a diameter of 2 cm initially to a diameter of 5 cm. Regional lymphatic spread with palpable nodules along the adjacent lymphatic vessel had occurred. With the patient's informed consent, treatment with oral miltefosine, according to his body weight of 96 kg, was started at 50 mg three times daily for 28 days. The treatment was well tolerated without any subjective side-effects reported. Liver enzymes, serum creatinine, and urea were monitored during treatment. There was a mild increase in liver enzymes during the third week of treatment: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 49 U/L (normal, {\textless} 35 U/L); alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 107 U/L (normal, {\textless} 45 U/L); this resolved spontaneously. Ten days after completion of treatment, the rolled edge had disappeared and the central ulcer had almost healed (Fig. 3). Figure 4 shows the lesion 5 months after completion of treatment.},

	abstract = {Many antimalarials sold in sub-Saharan Africa are poor-quality (falsified, substandard, or degraded), and the burden of disease caused by this problem is inadequately quantified. In this article, we estimate the number of under-five deaths caused by ineffective treatment of malaria associated with consumption of poor-quality antimalarials in 39 sub-Saharan countries. Using Latin hypercube sampling our estimates were calculated as the product of the number of private sector antimalarials consumed by malaria-positive children in 2013; the proportion of private sector antimalarials consumed that were of poor-quality; and the case fatality rate (CFR) of under-five malaria-positive children who did not receive appropriate treatment. An estimated 122,350 (interquartile range [IQR]: 91,577-154,736) under-five malaria deaths were associated with consumption of poor-quality antimalarials, representing 3.75\% (IQR: 2.81-4.75\%) of all under-five deaths in our sample of 39 countries. There is considerable uncertainty surrounding our results because of gaps in data on case fatality rates and prevalence of poor-quality antimalarials. Our analysis highlights the need for further investigation into the distribution of poor-quality antimalarials and the need for stronger surveillance and regulatory efforts to prevent the sale of poor-quality antimalarials.},

Symptomatic disease is subacute or chronic and diverse in presentation and outcome. Clinical characteristics vary further by endemic region. Despite T-cell-dependent immune responses, which produce asymptomatic and self-healing infection, or appropriate treatment, intracellular infection is probably life-long since targeted cells (tissue macrophages) allow residual parasites to persist. There is an epidemic of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and Pakistan and of visceral infection in India and Sudan. Diagnosis relies on visualising parasites in tissue or serology; culture and detection of parasite DNA are useful in the laboratory. Pentavalent antimony is the conventional treatment; however, resistance of visceral infection in India has spawned new treatment approaches--amphotericin B and its lipid formulations, injectable paromomycin, and oral miltefosine. Despite tangible advances in diagnosis, treatment, and basic scientific research, leishmaniasis is embedded in poverty and neglected. Current obstacles to realistic prevention and proper management include inadequate vector (sandfly) control, no vaccine, and insufficient access to or impetus for developing affordable new drugs.},

Additional information was collated during meetings conducted at WHO regional level between 2007 and 2011. Two questionnaires regarding epidemiology and drug access were completed by experts and national program managers. Visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis incidence ranges were estimated by country and epidemiological region based on reported incidence, underreporting rates if available, and the judgment of national and international experts. Based on these estimates, approximately 0.2 to 0.4 cases and 0.7 to 1.2 million VL and CL cases, respectively, occur each year. More than 90\% of global VL cases occur in six countries: India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Brazil. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is more widely distributed, with about one-third of cases occurring in each of three epidemiological regions, the Americas, the Mediterranean basin, and western Asia from the Middle East to Central Asia. The ten countries with the highest estimated case counts, Afghanistan, Algeria, Colombia, Brazil, Iran, Syria, Ethiopia, North Sudan, Costa Rica and Peru, together account for 70 to 75\% of global estimated CL incidence. Mortality data were extremely sparse and generally represent hospital-based deaths only. Using an overall case-fatality rate of 10\%, we reach a tentative estimate of 20,000 to 40,000 leishmaniasis deaths per year. Although the information is very poor in a number of countries, this is the first in-depth exercise to better estimate the real impact of leishmaniasis. These data should help to define control strategies and reinforce leishmaniasis advocacy.},

Public-sector health workers are vital to the functioning of health systems. We aimed to investigate pay structures for health workers in the public sector in sub-Saharan Africa; the adequacy of incomes for health workers; the management of public-sector pay; and the fiscal and macroeconomic factors that impinge on pay policy for the public sector. Because salary differentials affect staff migration and retention, we also discuss pay in the private sector. We surveyed historical trends in the pay of civil servants in Africa over the past 40 years. We used some empirical data, but found that accurate and complete data were scarce. The available data suggested that pay structures vary across countries, and are often structured in complex ways. Health workers also commonly use other sources of income to supplement their formal pay. The pay and income of health workers varies widely, whether between countries, by comparison with cost of living, or between the public and private sectors. To optimise the distribution and mix of health workers, policy interventions to address their pay and incomes are needed. Fiscal constraints to increased salaries might need to be overcome in many countries, and non-financial incentives improved.},

	abstract = {Miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine, MIL), registered as Impavido((R)), has become the first oral drug for the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmanasis. MIL is a simple molecule, very stable, relatively safe and highly efficient in clinical trials. However, MIL requires a long treatment course (28 days) and has a long half-life (around 150h), which might accelerate the emergence of drug resistance in case of inadequate use. The mechanisms of MIL resistance have been studied in vitro with experimental resistant lines. Resistance was shown to develop quickly in Leishmania promastigotes. Interestingly, a decreased MIL accumulation has always accounted for the resistance phenotype. The lower MIL accumulation can be achieved by two independent mechanisms: (i) an increase in drug efflux, mediated by the overexpression of the ABC transporter P-glycoprotein, and (ii) a decrease in drug uptake, which is easily achieved by the inactivation of any one of the two proteins known to be responsible for the MIL uptake, the MIL transporter LdMT and its beta subunit LdRos3. Policies concerning a proper use of this drug should be followed and supervised by health authorities of endemic areas to minimalize the risk for the appearance of drug failures and to ensure a long life span for this effective oral drug.},

The assay has been validated for miltefosine from 4 to 2000 ng/mL using 250 microL human EDTA plasma samples. Results from the validation demonstrate that miltefosine can be accurately and precisely quantified in human plasma. At the lowest level, the intra-assay precision was lower than 10.7\%, the inter-assay precision was 10.6\% and accuracies were between 95.1 and 109\%.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess patient adherence to unsupervised single-drug miltefosine treatment for visceral leishmaniasis and to identify the factors influencing adherence.
METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 171 patients with Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in three healthcare settings in Nepal. Adherence was assessed through pill count, checking of treatment cards and adherence questionnaires, as well as miltefosine concentration measurements at the end of treatment. Poor adherence was defined as less than 90\% of required capsules taken.
RESULTS: Patient adherence to miltefosine was 83\%. Predictors of adherence were being the male sex (OR = 2.60, 95\% CI 1.02-6.67) and knowing the duration of treatment (OR = 3.05, 95\% CI 1.16-8.04). Adherence was also better for patients who were literate and knew the side effects of treatment. Gastrointestinal side effects and negligence after the resolution of clinical symptoms of VL were the main reasons for poor adherence. Poor adherence was associated (though not statistically significant) with future relapse.
CONCLUSION: Effective counselling during the treatment, a short take-home message on VL and on side effects and action of miltefosine, and follow-up visits are the best way to prevent poor adherence. Single end-of-treatment measurements of miltefosine concentrations as objective assessment of adherence would only be useful in addition to the subjective assessments when substantial doses of miltefosine have been missed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has emerged as an important opportunistic pathogen in recent years. Increasing antimicrobial resistance and other contraindications have greatly compromised trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) as the first-line therapeutic option. The objective of this study was to explore other options for treating hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) caused by S. maltophilia.
METHODS: A total of 102 strains of S. maltophilia were isolated from sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens of patients with HAP in our institution. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of minocycline, tigecycline, moxifloxacin, and levofloxacin were determined by the agar dilution method. Based on the MICs and the population pharmacokinetic parameters of the investigated antimicrobials, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed to simulate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) indices of different regimens. The probability of target attainment (PTA) was estimated at each MIC value and the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) was calculated to evaluate the efficacy of these regimens.
RESULTS: The susceptibility rates to minocycline, tigecycline, moxifloxacin, and levofloxacin were 96.1\%, 80.4\%, 74.5\%, and 69.6\%, respectively. The estimated CFRs were 96.2\% for minocycline 100 mg twice daily; 50.8\%/67.1\%/75.4\% for tigecycline 50/75/100 mg twice daily; 34.3\%/48.0\%/56.6\% for levofloxacin 500/750/1000 mg once daily; and 45.7\% for moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily.
CONCLUSIONS: The simulation results suggest that minocycline may be a proper choice for treatment of HAP caused by S. maltophilia, while tigecycline, moxifloxacin, and levofloxacin may not be optimal as monotherapy.},

	abstract = {A dermatosis commonly known as post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) may develop following the treatment of human visceral leishmaniasis (VL). In about 15\% of PKDL cases the disfiguring lesions persist, sometimes for many years. Such persistent lesions currently require daily injections of sodium stibogluconate (SSG) for 2-4 months and even then treatment may not be successful. Alternative, quicker and cheaper treatment options that cause less toxicity are being explored. Immuno-chemotherapeutic regimens (based on leishmaniasis candidate vaccines/BCG with SSG) are still experimental but treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) has already been found effective, albeit in a small number of patients. AmBisome is considered less nephrotoxic than non-liposomal amphotericin B because it specifically targets the macrophages in which the Leishmania parasites develop. The aim of the present study was to evaluate further the usefulness of AmBisome in the treatment of persistent PKDL, in Sudan. The 12 subjects, all of whom gave their informed consent, had each had PKDL lesions for {\textgreater}6 months and shown no improvement after repeated injections of SSG. During the study period, they were hospitalized and regularly screened, haematologically and biochemically, for adverse effects. The AmBisome, given intravenously at 2.5 mg/kg.day for 20 days, completely cleared the skin rash of 10 (83\%) of the patients and caused no detectable adverse effects. In the 10 patients who responded well to the treatment, the papular lesions regressed and became flat while the hypopigmented lesions darkened (continuing to do so even after the last AmBisome injections). Treatment outcome appeared to be unaffected by the age or gender of the patient (P = 0.7 for each) but the time taken for the PKDL lesions to heal was correlated with the age of the lesions (P = 0.009). The macular lesions healed more slowly than the papular (P = 0.02). In conclusion, Ambisome appears suitable for the treatment of persistent PKDL lesions in Sudan. Once certain favourable clinical signs (the regression and/or darkening of the PKDL lesions) have been noted, the lesions will probably continue to clear without the need for more injections.},

Over 60\% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis in Bihar State, India, do not respond to treatment with pentavalent antimonials. This is now considered to be due to acquired resistance. Although this class of drugs has been used for over 60 years for leishmaniasis treatment, it is only in the past 2 years that the mechanisms of action and resistance have been identified, related to drug metabolism, thiol metabolism, and drug efflux. With the introduction of new therapies, including miltefosine in 2002 and paromomycin in 2005-2006, it is essential that there be a strategy to prevent the emergence of resistance to new drugs; combination therapy, monitoring of therapy, and improved diagnostics could play an essential role in this strategy.},

Interferon-gamma-inducible protein (IP)-10 and monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig) are CXC chemokines, the production of which, at least in part, is IFN-gamma dependent. A follow-up study of individuals infected with Leishmania donovani was undertaken in an area of Ethiopia endemic for visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Plasma levels of IFN-gamma, IL-12p40, IL-18, IL-15, IP-10, and Mig were markedly elevated in symptomatic VL patients (n = 70) compared with individuals with asymptomatic Leishmania infections (n = 39), malaria patients (n = 13), and healthy controls from the endemic area (n = 12). A significant decrease of IFN-gamma and all mediators was observed after treatment of VL patients (n = 33). These data show that increased plasma levels of IFN-gamma, as well as the mediators involved in the production and the activity of this cytokine, are characteristic of active VL in humans, and may play an important immunopathogenic role. The data also suggest that in patients with VL, the production of type 1 cytokines is not depressed, but there appears to be an unresponsiveness to the stimuli of type 1 cytokines. The underlying causes of immunologic unresponsiveness remain a subject of further investigation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: SSG\&PM over 17 days is recommended as first line treatment for visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Africa, but is painful and requires hospitalization. Combination regimens including AmBisome and miltefosine are safe and effective in India, but there are no published data from trials of combination therapies including these drugs from Africa.
METHODS: A phase II open-label, non-comparative randomized trial was conducted in Sudan and Kenya to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three treatment regimens: 10 mg/kg single dose AmBisome plus 10 days of SSG (20 mg/kg/day), 10 mg/kg single dose AmBisome plus 10 days of miltefosine (2.5mg/kg/day) and miltefosine alone (2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days). The primary endpoint was initial parasitological cure at Day 28, and secondary endpoints included definitive cure at Day 210, and pharmacokinetic (miltefosine) and pharmacodynamic assessments.
RESULTS: In sequential analyses with 49-51 patients per arm, initial cure was 85\% (95\% CI: 73-92) in all arms. At D210, definitive cure was 87\% (95\% CI: 77-97) for AmBisome + SSG, 77\% (95\% CI 64-90) for AmBisome + miltefosine and 72\% (95\% CI 60-85) for miltefosine alone, with lower efficacy in younger patients, who weigh less. Miltefosine pharmacokinetic data indicated under-exposure in children compared to adults.
CONCLUSION: No major safety concerns were identified, but point estimates of definitive cure were less than 90\% for each regimen so none will be evaluated in Phase III trials in their current form. Allometric dosing of miltefosine in children needs to be evaluated.

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the development of new drugs for the treatment of leishmaniasis. This has spurred the need for pharmacodynamic markers to monitor and compare therapies specifically for visceral leishmaniasis, in which the primary recrudescence of parasites is a particularly long-term event that remains difficult to predict. We performed a systematic review of studies evaluating biomarkers in human patients with visceral, cutaneous, and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, which yielded a total of 170 studies in which 53 potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers were identified. In conclusion, the large majority of these biomarkers constituted universal indirect markers of activation and subsequent waning of cellular immunity and therefore lacked specificity. Macrophage-related markers demonstrate favorable sensitivity and times to normalcy, but more evidence is required to establish a link between these markers and clinical outcome. Most promising are the markers directly related to the parasite burden, but future effort should be focused on optimization of molecular or antigenic targets to increase the sensitivity of these markers. In general, future research should focus on the longitudinal evaluation of the pharmacodynamic biomarkers during treatment, with an emphasis on the correlation of studied biomarkers and clinical parameters.},

There were 699 patients clinically suspected of having VL (153 parasitologically confirmed, 482 DAT confirmed, and 130 DAT negative), and 97 DAT-negative controls. A total of 84\% were tested for HIV and 34\% were HIV positive. Sensitivity of the rK39 test in parasitologically confirmed VL patients was 84\% (77\% in HIV positive and 87\% in HIV negative; P = 0.25). Sensitivity of the DAT was higher (94\%; P = 0.01), 89\% in HIV-positive patients and 95\% in HIV-negative patients; P = 0.27). Specificity of the rK39 test was 99\% in DAT-negative controls and 92\% in DAT-negative patients clinically suspected of having VL. A diagnostic algorithm combining DAT and the rK39 test had a sensitivity of 98\% in HIV-positive VL patients and 99\% in HIV-negative VL patients. Despite the lower sensitivity in a population with a high prevalence of HIV, the DiaMed-IT-Leish rK39 test enables decentralization of diagnosis. Patients clinically suspected of having VL who show negative results on the rK39 antigen test should undergo follow-up DAT testing, especially if they are HIV positive.},

Early guidelines on the dosage of pentamidine were based on the base-moiety of the two different formulations available. Confusion on the dosage of pentamidine arose from a different labelling of the two available products, either based on the salt or base moiety available in the preparation. We provide an overview of the various guidelines concerning HAT and leishmaniasis over the past decades and show the confusion in the calculation of the dosage of pentamidine in these guidelines and the subsequent published reports on clinical trials and reviews. At present, only pentamidine isethionate is available, but the advised dosage for HAT and leishmaniasis is (historically) based on the amount of pentamidine base. In the treatment of leishmaniasis this is probably resulting in a subtherapeutic treatment. There is thus a need for a new, more transparent and concise guideline concerning the dosage of pentamidine, at least in the treatment of HAT and leishmaniasis.},

Delta-ALA is also elevated in the urine of animals and patients treated with the investigational drug dichloroacetate (DCA). We postulated that delta-ALA may be responsible, in part, for the peripheral neuropathy observed in subjects receiving DCA. To test this hypothesis, myelinating cocultures of Schwann cells and sensory neurons were exposed to delta-ALA (0.1-1 mM) and analyzed for the expression of neural proteins and lipids and markers of oxidative stress. Exposure of myelinating samples to delta-ALA is associated with a pronounced reduction in the levels of myelin-associated lipids and proteins, including myelin protein zero and peripheral myelin protein 22. We also observed an increase in protein carbonylation and the formation of hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde after treatment with delta-ALA. Studies of isolated Schwann cells and neurons indicate that glial cells are more vulnerable to this pro-oxidant than neurons, based on a selective decrease in the expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins in glial, but not in neuronal, cells. These results suggest that the neuropathic effects of delta-ALA are attributable, at least in part, to its pro-oxidant properties which damage myelinating Schwann cells.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study was conducted in Bangladeshi patients in an outpatient setting to support registration of Paromomycin Intramuscular Injection (PMIM) as a low-cost treatment option in Bangladesh.
METHODOLOGY: This Phase IIIb, open-label, multi-center, single-arm trial assessed the efficacy and safety of PMIM administered at 11 mg/kg (paromomycin base) intramuscularly once daily for 21 consecutive days to children and adults with VL in a rural outpatient setting in Bangladesh. Patients ≥5 and ≤55 years were eligible if they had signs and symptoms of VL (intermittent fever, weight loss/decreased appetite, and enlarged spleen), positive rK39 test, and were living in VL-endemic areas. Compliance was the percentage of enrolled patients who received 21 daily injections over no more than 22 days. Efficacy was evaluated by initial clinical response, defined as resolution of fever and reduction of splenomegaly at end of treatment, and final clinical response, defined as the absence of new clinical signs and symptoms of VL 6 months after end of treatment. Safety was assessed by evaluation of adverse events.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 120 subjects (49\% pediatric) were enrolled. Treatment compliance was 98.3\%. Initial clinical response in the Intent-to-Treat population was 98.3\%, and final clinical response 6 months after end of treatment was 94.2\%. Of the 119 subjects who received ≥1 dose of PMIM, 28.6\% reported at least one adverse event. Injection site pain was the most commonly reported adverse event. Reversible renal impairment and/or hearing loss were reported in 2 subjects.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: PMIM was an effective and safe treatment for VL in Bangladesh. The short treatment duration and lower cost of PMIM compared with other treatment options may make this drug a preferred treatment to be investigated as part of a combination therapy regimen. This study supports the registration of PMIM for use in government health facilities in Bangladesh.

	abstract = {Gaucher disease is characterized by storage of glucosylceramide in lysosomes of tissue macrophages as the result of an autosomal recessively inherited deficiency in glucocerebrosidase. Progressive accumulation of these glycolipid-laden Gaucher cells causes a variety of debilitating symptoms. The disease can be effectively treated by costly intravenous infusions with recombinant glucocerebrosidase. Chitotriosidase is massively secreted by Gaucher cells and its plasma levels are used to monitor efficacy of enzyme therapy. Broad-scale application is hampered by the common genetic defect in this surrogate marker. We report that in plasma of symptomatic patients with Gaucher disease the chemokine CCL18 is on average 29-fold elevated, without overlap between patient and control values (median control plasma level is 33 ng/mL, range, 10-72 ng/mL; median Gaucher plasma level is 948 ng/mL, range, 237-2285 ng/mL). Plasma CCL18 concentrations decrease during therapy, comparably to chitotriosidase levels. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates that Gaucher cells are the prominent source of CCL18. Plasma CCL18 levels can serve as alternative surrogate marker for storage cells in patients with Gaucher disease and monitoring of plasma CCL18 levels proves to be useful in determination of therapeutic efficacy, especially in patients who are deficient in chitotriosidase activity. The potential physiologic consequences of chronically elevated CCL18 in patients with Gaucher disease are discussed.},

Despite relevant findings suggesting changes on lymphocytes subsets regarding the CVL clinical forms, it still remains to be elucidated whether a distinct phenotypic profile would be correlated with degree of tissue parasite density. Herein, we have assessed the correlation between the clinical status as well as the impact of bone marrow parasite density on the phenotypic profile of peripheral blood leucocytes in 40 Brazilian dogs naturally infected by Leishmania chagasi. Our major findings describe the lower frequency of B cells and monocytes as the most important markers of severe CVL. Our main statistically significant findings reveal that the CD8(+) T cell subset reflects most accurately both the clinical status and the overall bone marrow parasite density, as increased levels of CD8(+) lymphocytes appeared as the major phenotypic feature of asymptomatic disease and dogs bearing a low parasite load. Moreover, enhanced major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II density as well as a higher CD45RB/CD45RA expression index seems to represent a key element to control disease morbidity. The association between clinical status, bone marrow parasitism and CD8(+) T cells re-emphasizes the role of the T cell-mediated immune response in the resistance mechanisms during ongoing CVL. Higher levels of circulating T lymphocytes (both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells) and lower MHC-II expression by peripheral blood lymphocytes seem to be the key for the effective immunological response, a hallmark of asymptomatic CVL.},

Since patients with systemic mycoses frequently present with a significant co-morbidity, pharmacokinetics under special conditions such as renal insufficiency, renal replacement therapy or impaired liver function have to be considered. Amphotericin B is eliminated unchanged by the liver and the kidney. Its plasma protein binding accounts for 95 to 99 percent. Conventional amphotericin B deoxycholate has a remarkable infusion related and renal toxicity. Therefore, lipid formulations have been developed. By now, three lipid formulations are therapeutically used: liposomal amphotericin B, amphotericin B colloidal dispersion and amphotericin B lipid complex. Striking differences in their plasma pharmacokinetics have been found. These differences can be attributed to the diverse disposition of the lipid moieties, while liberated amphotericin B displays a pharmacokinetic behavior which is independent from the lipid-formulation applied. The highest amphotericin B tissue concentrations have been found in the liver and in the spleen, followed by lung, kidney and heart. Concentrations in brain tissue are very low. Flucytosine has no relevant protein binding and is eliminated by glomerular filtration. Fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole and ravuconazole are triazoles, used for treatment of systemic fungal infections. Significant drug interactions have to be considered during therapy with triazoles, particularly in patients dependent on immunosuppression. These interactions are caused by the metabolism of triazoles in the liver where the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system is involved at a different extend as well as by their mechanisms of action. Triazoles display a favorable tissue distribution with high penetration into the central nervous system. Echinocandins such as caspofungin and micafungin are rapidly taken up by peripheral tissues, particularly by the liver. In the first 24 hours this uptake appears to be the main route of elimination from plasma. Enzymatic degradation takes place, but is independent of CYP. Thus, drug interactions are a minor problem during echinocandin treatment. The highest tissue levels of caspofungin and micafungin have been measured in the liver. Moderate concentrations are achieved in lung, spleen and kidney. Penetration into the brain is relatively poor.},

In this article we describe a programming library, Perl-speaks-NONMEM (PsN), intended for programmers that aim at using the computational capability of NONMEM in external applications. The library is object oriented and written in the programming language Perl. The classes of the library are built around NONMEM's data, model and output files. The specification of the NONMEM model is easily set or changed through the model and data file classes while the output from a model fit is accessed through the output file class. The classes have methods that help the programmer perform common repetitive tasks, e.g. summarising the output from a NONMEM run, setting the initial estimates of a model based on a previous run or truncating values over a certain threshold in the data file. PsN creates a basis for the development of high-level software using NONMEM as the regression tool.},

We report two cases of endonasal primary Leishmaniasis, which is a very rare event in adult men who are immunocompetent, born in, and residents of Sardinia. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of intra and extracellular Leishmania amastigotes in the histological smear. Isoenzymatic characterization identified Leishmania infantum zymodeme MON-111 in both cases. Laboratory and instrumental investigations excluded visceral involvement. Treatment with meglumine antimoniate (Glucantim) intralesional administration, 1 ml weekly for 4-5 weeks, led to complete resolution. The unusual location is likely a reflection an uncommon site of inoculation of the protozoa, transmitted by flying vectors. The patients were a shepherd and a farmer, respectively, both professions at high risk of infection because of their habits of sleeping outdoors under trees or in country cottages during spring and summer and exposed to sand fly bites. Although mucosal involvement and infection by Leishmania infantum, a potential cause of visceral leishmaniasis, the Sardinian patients experienced a benign disease course considering muco-cutaneous forms described in the New World. Differential diagnosis and early detection are necessary in order to start effective treatment and prevent more serious complications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Accumulation of macrophages in multiple organs is a common feature of sarcoidosis and Gaucher disease. The vast number of storage macrophages in Gaucher patients has facilitated the discovery of suitable plasma markers like chitotriosidase and CCL18.


METHODS

Plasma specimens of patients with sarcoidosis were examined on chitotriosidase activity and CCL18 protein levels.


RESULTS

Chitotriosidase was markedly increased, being on average 13.7-fold elevated (range: 1.1-43.3). The sensitivity of demonstrating sarcoidosis using plasma chitotriosidase values exceeded that using serum angiotensin-converting enzyme values. A 3.5-fold (range: 1-15) increase in CCL18 was also observed. The relative changes in chitotriosidase and CCL18 during the course of disease closely mimicked each other, suggesting an identical cellular source. In situ hybridization analysis confirmed massive production of chitotriosidase by sarcoid macrophages. The increase in plasma chitotriosidase correlated with the stage of disease, being highest in active sarcoidosis with extrapulmonary involvement. Therapy with steroids resulted in clear reduction of plasma chitotriosidase and CCL18 and relapse of disease activity was preceded by increases in these parameters.


CONCLUSIONS

Sarcoid macrophages secrete high quantities of chitotriosidase and CCL18. Determination of plasma chitotriosidase and CCL18 may be useful to monitor changes in granulomatous macrophages during the course of sarcoidosis.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Use of miltefosine in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is hampered by its potential teratogenicity. The duration of adequate contraceptive cover in females of child-bearing potential after cessation of a potentially teratogenic drug therapy remains debated. The objective of this study was to provide a rational approach to suggest durations of contraceptive cover for various miltefosine regimens.
METHODS: A human reproductive safety threshold exposure limit was derived using animal-to-human dose conversion. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data for miltefosine in females are lacking; a previously developed population PK model and a comprehensive anthropometric dataset were used to simulate PK data for Indian female VL patients receiving miltefosine for 5, 7, 10 or 28 days. Probability of supra-threshold miltefosine exposure was used to evaluate adequate durations of post-treatment contraceptive cover for the various regimens.
RESULTS: PK data were simulated for 465 treated Indian female VL patients of child-bearing potential with a median age of 25 years (IQR 16-31 years) and median weight of 38 kg (IQR 34-42 kg). From animal reproductive toxicity studies, a human reproductive safety threshold exposure limit was derived of 24.5 μg · day/mL. Probability of 'unprotected' supra-threshold miltefosine exposure was very low ({\textless}0.2\%) for a post-treatment contraceptive cover period of 4 months for the standard 28 day regimen, and of 2 months for the shorter regimens.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study providing rational suggestions for contraceptive cover for a teratogenic drug based on animal-to-human dose conversion. For the 28 day miltefosine regimen, post-treatment contraceptive cover may be extended to 4 months, whereas for all shorter regimens 2 months may be adequate.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Miltefosine (MIL), the only oral drug for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), is currently the first-line therapy in the VL elimination program of the Indian subcontinent. Given the paucity of anti-VL drugs and the looming threat of resistance, there is an obvious need for close monitoring of clinical efficacy of MIL.
METHODS: In a cohort study of 120 VL patients treated with MIL in Nepal, we monitored the clinical outcomes up to 12 months after completion of therapy and explored the potential role of drug compliance, parasite drug resistance, and reinfection.
RESULTS: The initial cure rate was 95.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 92.2-99.4) and the relapse rate at 6 and 12 months was 10.8\% (95\% CI, 5.2-16.4) and 20.0\% (95\% CI, 12.8-27.2) , respectively. No significant clinical risk factors of relapse apart from age {\textless}12 years were found. Parasite fingerprints of pretreatment and relapse bone marrow isolates within 8 patients were similar, suggesting that clinical relapses were not due to reinfection with a new strain. The mean promastigote MIL susceptibility (50\% inhibitory concentration) of isolates from definite cures was similar to that of relapses. Although more tolerant strains were observed, parasite resistance, as currently measured, is thus not likely involved in MIL treatment failure. Moreover, MIL blood levels at the end of treatment were similar in cured and relapsed patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Relapse in one-fifth of the MIL-treated patients observed in our study is an alarming signal for the VL elimination campaign, urging for further review and cohort monitoring.},

For 10 years it has been licensed in India for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a fatal neglected parasitic disease. It is the first and still the only oral drug that can be used to treat VL and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). The standard 28 day miltefosine monotherapy regimen is well tolerated, except for mild gastrointestinal side effects, although its teratogenic potential severely hampers its general use in the clinic and roll-out in national elimination programmes. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine are mainly characterized by its long residence time in the body, resulting in extensive drug accumulation during treatment and long elimination half-lives. At the moment, different combination therapy strategies encompassing miltefosine are being tested in multiple controlled clinical trials in various geographical areas of endemicity, both in South Asia and East Africa. We here review the most salient pre-clinical and clinical pharmacological aspects of miltefosine, its mechanism of action against Leishmania parasites and other pathogens, and provide a systematic overview of the efficacy and safety data from all clinical trials of miltefosine, either alone or in combination, in the treatment of VL and CL.},

The prevalence of reflux disease is increasing, as is the incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma, a complication that is strongly correlated with chronic reflux disease. Although these agents are generally safe, a number of potential side effects have been described and a careful assessment of the risks and benefits of PPI therapy is required in all patients being prescribed long-term therapy. Overutilization of PPIs is a problem in clinical practice and needs further attention. PPI use has been associated with osteoporosis and bone fracture, hypomagnesaemia, the development of gastric polyps, enteric infections, interstitial nephritis and pneumonia. Patients on long-term therapy should be periodically evaluated for the indications for continued therapy. Despite widespread publicity in the lay press, and regulatory guidance regarding a number of associations, the evidence for serious side effects is poor and the risk of confounding remains a real possibility for many associations. Patients are more concerned about the absolute risk of developing a complication than a relative risk. The absolute risk of all the complications attributed to PPIs is low and patients who need long-term PPI therapy need a clear discussion of the available data on the risk of therapy and also a discussion of the risk of continued reflux.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent reports indicated high miltefosine treatment failure rates for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) on the Indian subcontinent. To further explore the pharmacological factors associated with these treatment failures, a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study was performed to examine the relationship between miltefosine drug exposure and treatment failure in a cohort of Nepalese patients with VL.
METHODS: Miltefosine steady-state blood concentrations at the end of treatment were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling and a logistic regression model. Individual estimates of miltefosine exposure were explored for their relationship with treatment failure.
RESULTS: The overall probability of treatment failure was 21\%. The time that the blood concentration was {\textgreater}10 times the half maximal effective concentration of miltefosine (median, 30.2 days) was significantly associated with treatment failure: each 1-day decrease in miltefosine exposure was associated with a 1.08-fold (95\% confidence interval, 1.01-1.17) increased odds of treatment failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Achieving a sufficient exposure to miltefosine is a significant and critical factor for VL treatment success, suggesting an urgent need to evaluate the recently proposed optimal allometric miltefosine dosing regimen. This study establishes the first evidence for a drug exposure-effect relationship for miltefosine in the treatment of VL.},

AUC(SS(0-24)) values were divided by clinically relevant fixed MIC values to derive AUC(SS(0-24))/MIC ratios, which were used to calculate the clinical response expectation by MIC value based upon a logistic regression model for efficacy (1st approach). For the 2nd approach, the probability of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) target attainment was calculated as the proportion of patients with AUC(SS(0-24))/MIC ratios greater than the threshold value of 6.96, the PK-PD target associated with optimal clinical response. Probabilities of clinical response and PK-PD target attainment were poorly correlated at MIC values {\textgreater}0.25 mg/L. For instance, the median probability of clinical success was 0.76, whereas the probability of PK-PD target attainment was 0.27 at an MIC value of 1 mg/L, suggesting that the probability of PK-PD target attainment metrics underestimates the clinical performance of tigecycline at higher MIC values.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Malaria Clinical Trials Alliance (MCTA), a programme of INDEPTH network of demographic surveillance centres, was launched in 2006 with two broad objectives: to facilitate the timely development of a network of centres in Africa with the capacity to conduct clinical trials of malaria vaccines and drugs under conditions of good clinical practice (GCP); and to support, strengthen and mentor the centres in the network to facilitate their progression towards self-sustaining clinical research centres.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Sixteen research centres in 10 African malaria-endemic countries were selected that were already working with the Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) or the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV). All centres were visited to assess their requirements for research capacity development through infrastructure strengthening and training. Support provided by MCTA included: laboratory and facility refurbishment; workshops on GCP, malaria diagnosis, strategic management and media training; and training to support staff to undertake accreditation examinations of the Association of Clinical Research Professionals (ACRP). Short attachments to other network centres were also supported to facilitate sharing practices within the Alliance. MCTA also played a key role in the creation of the African Media \& Malaria Research Network (AMMREN), which aims to promote interaction between researchers and the media for appropriate publicity and media reporting of research and developments on malaria, including drug and vaccine trials.
CONCLUSION: In three years, MCTA strengthened 13 centres to perform GCP-compliant drug and vaccine trials, including 11 centres that form the backbone of a large phase III malaria vaccine trial. MCTA activities have demonstrated that centres can be brought up to GCP compliance on this time scale, but the costs are substantial and there is a need for further support of other centres to meet the growing demand for clinical trial capacity. The MCTA experience also indicates that capacity development in clinical trials is best carried out in the context of preparation for specific trials. In this regard MCTA centres involved in the phase III malaria vaccine trial were, on average, more successful at consolidating the training and infrastructure support than those centres focussing only on drug trials.},

KAtex detects a low molecular weight, heat-stable, carbohydrate antigen in the urine of VL patients. KAtex was performed using freshly voided urine samples obtained from 36 parasitologically confirmed cases of VL before and after treatment as well as from 40 healthy controls (20 each from kala-azar-endemic and non-endemic zones). KAtex was found to be positive in 27 (75\%) of the 36 patients at diagnosis and was negative in all the controls. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of KAtex were 75\% (95\% CI 57-87\%) and 100\% (95\% CI 89-100\%), respectively. Following treatment, all 36 VL cases were negative for Leishman-Donovan bodies by splenic smear microscopy and 34 (94.4\%) were negative by KAtex. This limited study suggests that KAtex is a satisfactorily sensitive, highly specific, rapid and completely non-invasive urine-based antigen detection test for the diagnosis of VL. Currently, this is the only non-invasive laboratory tool useful for the assessment of initial cure in VL patients.},

	abstract = {This study was a randomized, open label comparison that was designed to determine efficacy and safety of miltefosine as the first oral drug for the treatment of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major in comparison with meglumine antimoniate. Complete clinical response was defined as 100\% re-epithelialization of the lesion. Definitions of lesion cure and failure were based on both clinical and parasitological criteria two weeks after the end of treatment and clinical recovery three months after this period. Of 32 patients enrolled for miltefosine treatment 28 patients completed treatment, of which 26 were cured at three months, corresponding to a cure rate of 92.9\% on a per protocol analysis, and 81.3\% according to intention to treat analysis. There was one failure (3.1\%), one relapse (3.1\%) and four dropouts due to lack of tolerability (12.5\%) during the first week of treatment. Of 31 patients who received intramuscular meglumine antimoniate (20mgSb(5)/kg body weight daily for 14 days) 25 were cured (83.3\% on a per protocol basis, 80.6\% on intention to treat basis), five failed (16.1\%) and one was lost (3.2\%) at 3-month follow-up. At 6-month follow-up after the end of treatment, no relapse was observed. Both regimens were tolerated but averages of nausea (32.2\%) and vomiting (21.5\%) were observed in patients during two weeks after initiation of miltefosine treatment. Other gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and total adverse events were not statistically different in the two groups during one to four weeks after therapy initiation. No relevant changes were observed in levels of liver enzymes, creatinine and hematological tests before and after end of treatment in both groups. In conclusion, miltefosine is apparently at least as good as meglumine antimoniate for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. major in Iran, based on parasitological as well as clinical criteria two weeks, three months, and six months after end of treatment.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To facilitate the choice of the best visceral leishmaniasis (VL) treatment strategy for first-line health services in (VL)-endemic areas, we compared in a formal decision analysis the cost and the cost-effectiveness of the different available options.


METHODS

We selected four drug regimens for VL on the basis of frequency of use, feasibility and reported efficacy studies. The point estimates and the range of plausible values of effectiveness and cost were retrieved from a literature review. A decision tree was constructed and the strategy minimizing the cost per death averted was selected.


RESULTS

Treatment with amphotericin B deoxycholate was the most effective approach in the baseline analysis and averted 87.2\% of all deaths attributable to VL. The least expensive and the most cost-effective treatment was the miltefosine regimen, and the most expensive and the least cost-effective was AmBisome treatment. The cost of drug and medical care are the main determinants of the cost-effectiveness ranking of the alternative schemes. Sensitivity analysis showed that antimonial was competitive with miltefosine in the low-resistance regions.


CONCLUSION

In areas with {\textgreater}94\% response rates to antimonials, generic sodium stibogluconate remains the most cost-effective option for VL treatment, mainly due to low drug cost. In other regions, miltefosine is the most cost-effective option of treatment, but its use as a first-line drug is limited by its teratogenicity and rapid resistance development. AmBisome in mono- or combination therapy is too expensive to compete in cost-effectiveness with the other regimens.},

To describe the clinical presentation of patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection and factors associated with poor outcome in northwest Ethiopia.


METHOD

Retrospective review of 241 patients with VL (92 with and 149 without HIV co-infection).


RESULTS

HIV co-infection was present in 92 (38\%) of the patients. Clinical presentation of VL was indistinguishable between patients with and without HIV co-infection. Co-infected patients had a poorer outcome i.e. either death or treatment failure (31.5\%vs. 5.6\%, P {\textless} 0.001). The presence of tuberculosis or sepsis syndrome among patients with VL and HIV co-infected independently predicted death or treatment failure [odds ratio 4.5 (95\% CI 1.47-13.92, P = 0.009) and 9.1 (95\% CI 2.16-37.97, P = 0.003), respectively]. Despite having similar clinical presentation at the time of diagnosis, VL and HIV co-infected patients had a higher mortality and treatment failure than immunocompetent patients.


CONCLUSION

The frequency of HIV co-infection among patients with VL is high in the study area, and this co-infection was associated with death or treatment failure. The clinical management of VL in HIV co-infected patients is a major challenge that requires new treatment approaches to improve its outcome.},

The compounds were given orally at a daily dose of 75 mumol/kg body weight. After 6, 11, and 18 days, three rats in each treatment group were killed and the drug concentration in various tissues and fluids was determined. With the exception of the kidney (He-PC) and brain (He-PC and ET18-OCH3), steady-state levels of the drugs could be achieved in all organs investigated and in serum. Maximal concentrations of He-PC were found in the kidney, adrenal glands, and spleen, whereas the highest concentrations of ET18-OCH3 were detected in the adrenal glands, spleen, and small intestine. The concentrations of He-PC exceeded those of ET18-OCH3 in most tissues by a factor of about 2-25. Since samples of urine and feces did not contain detectable amounts of the compounds, the absorption of both lipid analogues was assumed to be complete. The total amount of He-PC recovered after 6, 11, and 18 days was 15\%, 12\%, and 6\%, respectively, and that of ET18-OCH3 was 1.3\%, 0.8\%, and 0.3\%, respectively. This indicates that the bioavailability of He-PC and ET18-OCH3 is not controlled by differences in the uptake of the two drugs, but by differences in their metabolism. The results could explain the differing efficacy of these two compounds in their antitumor action in animal models.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

The quality of medicines available in some less-developed countries is inadequate in terms of content of active ingredient. Reasons for the poor quality of drugs include widespread counterfeiting of medicines in less-developed countries, excessive decomposition of active ingredient as a result of high temperature and humidity, and poor quality assurance during the manufacture of medicinal products. Our aim was to investigate the quality of different drugs obtained from retail pharmacies in two urban areas of Nigeria, and, in instances of poor quality, to ascertain the reason why.


METHODS

We randomly collected 581 samples of 27 different drugs from 35 pharmacies in Lagos and Abuja in Nigeria. We analysed the medicines for drug content by validated chromatographic methods, and compared our results with pharmacopoeial requirements.


FINDINGS

279 (48\%) samples did not comply with set pharmacopoeial limits, and this proportion was uniform for the various types of drugs tested. Although some preparations contained no active ingredient, most had amounts just outside the pharmacopoeial limits. We identified samples with both too much and too little active drug content.


INTERPRETATION

The most probable cause of the poor quality of drugs is absence of adequate quality assurance during manufacture. Substandard drugs sold in the pharmacies of less-developed countries could contribute to global microbial resistance and therapeutic failure of infectious diseases.},

Here, a new method is presented, separating all major PC molecular species from a variety of biological samples in intact form using a single, short and isocratic run. Species were separated on two RP18 reverse-phase columns in series and all species displayed an exponential relation between retention time and the percentage of acetonitrile or triethylamine in the mobile phase, allowing optimization of the mobile phase on a theoretical base, rather than on time-consuming test-runs. The use of triethylamine as a volatile additive instead of choline chloride allowed the use of light scattering detection. On a molar base, the response of the detector was invariant between species and allowed quantification of as little as 50 pmoles. The method was tested using phosphatidylcholines with widely different molecular species patterns, such a PC from rat liver, porcine pulmonary surfactant, bovine heart, boar sperm cells, and the parasite Schistosoma mansoni. As only volatile components are present in the solvents, individual molecular species can easily be recovered in pure form from the column effluent, enabling their further analysis (e.g., scintillation counting).},

A modified infection model was used to simulate the pharmacokinetics of nemonoxacin following scaling of single oral doses and multiple oral dosing. Four S. pneumoniae strains with different penicillin sensitivities were selected, and the drug efficacy was quantified by the change in log colony counts within 24 h. A sigmoid maximum-effect (Emax) model was used to analyze the relationship between PK/PD parameters and drug effect. Analysis indicated that the killing pattern of nemonoxacin shows a dualism which is mainly concentration dependent when the MIC is low and that the better PK/PD index should be the area under the concentration-time curve for the free, unbound fraction of the drug divided by the MIC (fAUC0-24/MIC), which means that giving the total daily amount of drug as one dose is appropriate under those conditions. When the MIC is high, the time (T) dependency is important and the valid PK/PD index should be the cumulative percentage of a 24-h period in which the drug concentration exceeds the MIC under steady-state pharmacokinetic conditions (f\%T{\textgreater}MIC), which means that to split the maximum daily dose into several separate doses will benefit the eradication of the bacteria. To obtain a 3-log10-unit decrease, the target values of fAUC0-24/MIC and f\%T{\textgreater}MIC are 47.05 and 53.4\%, respectively.},

Selected single or combined multi-epitope peptide biomarkers were further associated with four different sensor platforms, classified as affinity biosensors, that may be suitable as general protocols for field diagnosis. We have also developed two methods for nanoparticle agglutination assays (a particle gel agglutination test and a magnetic microparticle [MMP]-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and two electrochemical biosensors (impedimetric and amperometric) for DNA and antibody detection. For the agglutination tests, micro- and nanoparticles were coupled with filamentous bacteriophages displaying the selected mimotopes on their surfaces, which has favored the formation of the antigen-antibody or peptide-protein complexes, amplifying the optical detection in ELISA assays or after the chromatographic separation of the microagglutinates. We have also demonstrated a proof-of-concept for the electrochemical biosensors by using electrodes modified with novel functionalized polymers. These electrochemical biosensors have proven to be fast, very sensitive, and specific for the detection of pathogen DNA and circulating antibodies of patients, which may become important in a wide range of diagnostic devices for many infectious agents.},

The metabolic pathways leading to its biosynthesis are likely to play a critical role in parasite development and survival and may offer a good target for antileishmanial chemotherapy. Phosphatidylcholine synthesis via the CDP-choline pathway requires transport of the choline precursor from the host. Here, we report the first characterization of choline transport in this parasite, which is carrier-mediated and exhibits Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent K(m) value of 2.5 microM for choline. This process is Na(+)-independent and requires an intact proton gradient to be fully functional. Choline transport into Leishmania is highly specific for choline and is inhibited by the choline carrier inhibitor hemicholinium-3, the channel blocker quinacrine, the antimalarial aminoquinolines quinine and quinidine, the antileishmanial phosphocholine analogs, miltefosine and edelfosine, and by choline analogs, most of which have antimalarial activities. Most importantly, choline analogs kill the promastigote form of the parasite in vitro in the low micromolar range. These results set the stage for the use of choline analogs in antileishmanial chemotherapy and shed new lights on the mechanism of action of the leishmanicidal phosphocholine analogs.},

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is treated with parenteral drugs for decades with decreasing rate cures. Miltefosine is an oral medication with anti-leishmania activity and may increase the cure rates and improve compliance.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS

This study is a randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of miltefosine versus pentavalent antimony (Sb(v)) in the treatment of patients with CL caused by Leishmania braziliensis in Bahia, Brazil. A total of 90 patients were enrolled in the trial; 60 were assigned to receive miltefosine and 30 to receive Sb(v). Six months after treatment, in the intention-to-treat analyses, the definitive cure rate was 53.3\% in the Sb(v) group and 75\% in the miltefosine group (difference of 21.7\%, 95\% CI 0.08\% to 42.7\%, p = 0.04). Miltefosine was more effective than Sb(v) in the age group of 13-65 years-old compared to 2-12 years-old group (78.9\% versus 45\% p = 0.02; 68.2\% versus 70\% p = 1.0, respectively). The incidence of adverse events was similar in the Sb(v) and miltefosine groups (76.7\% vs. 78.3\%). Vomiting (41.7\%), nausea (40\%), and abdominal pain (23.3\%) were significantly more frequent in the miltefosine group while arthralgias (20.7\%), mialgias (20.7\%) and fever (23.3\%) were significantly more frequent in the Sb(v) group.


CONCLUSIONS

This study demonstrates that miltefosine therapy is more effective than standard Sb(v) and safe for the treatment of CL caused by Leishmania braziliensis in Bahia, Brazil.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

There is no effective oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), a disseminated intracellular protozoal infection that occurs worldwide. Miltefosine, an alkyl phospholipid developed as an oral antineoplastic agent, is active against visceral infection in animal models. We tested safety, tolerance, and efficacy of miltefosine in kala-azar.


METHODS

Oral doses of miltefosine were given to six groups of five Indian men for 28 days: 50 mg every second day (group 1), 100 mg every second day (group 2), 100 mg/day (group 3), 150 mg/day (group 4), 200 mg/day (group 5), and 250 mg/day (group 6). Assessment for apparent cure--taken as an afebrile state with decreased spleen size and a splenic-aspirate parasite-density score of 0--was done on days 14 and 28. Definitive cure at 8 months required a parasite-free bone-marrow aspirate and no clinical evidence of relapse.


FINDINGS

21 of 30 patients were apparently cured on day 14. Transient episodes of vomiting and diarrhoea, were common during weeks 1-2 and were seen in 22 patients. Four other patients in groups 5 and 6 had miltefosine withdrawn after 7-10 days because of vomiting. One patient in group 6 developed renal insufficiency and severe diarrhoea and died on day 21. On day 28, all 29 remaining patients were apparently cured. By 8 months, seven of ten patients in groups 1 and 2 had relapsed; however, 18 of 19 patients treated daily (groups 3-6) appeared to be cured. Among the 21 definitive cures were the four patients treated for 10 days or less and 12 for whom previous therapy with pentavalent antimony had failed.


INTERPRETATION

Treatment with miltefosine at 100-150 mg/day for 4 weeks has promise as an effective oral treatment of visceral leishmaniasis including antimony-resistant infection.},

	abstract = {The role of anti-leishmanial immune response underlying the susceptibility/resistance during canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) has been recognized throughout ex vivo and in vitro investigations. Recently, we demonstrated that immunoglobulin levels (Igs), as well as the parasite load are relevant hallmarks of distinct clinical status of CVL. To further characterize and upgrade the background on this issue, herein, we have evaluated, in Leishmania (Leishmania) chagasi naturally infected dogs, the relationship between tissue parasitism (skin, bone marrow, spleen, liver and lymph node), the CVL clinical status (asymptomatic (AD), with no suggestive signs of the disease; oligosymptomatic (OD), with maximum three clinical signs-opaque bristles; localized alopecia and moderate loss of weight; symptomatic (SD), serologically positive with severe clinical signs of visceral leishmaniasis), and the humoral immunological profile of anti-Leishmania immunoglobulins (IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgM, IgA and IgE). Our major statistically significant findings revealed distinct patterns of tissue parasite density within L. chagasi-infected dogs despite their clinical status, pointing out the spleen and skin as the most relevant sites of high parasitism during ongoing CVL. Parasite density of bone marrow and spleen were the most reliable parasitological markers to decode the clinical status of CVL. Moreover, the parasite density of bone marrow better correlates with most anti-Leishmania Igs reactivity. Additionally, a prognostic hallmark for canine visceral leishmaniasis was found, highlighting strong correlation between IgG1 and asymptomatic disease, but with IgA, IgE and IgG2 displaying better association with symptomatic disease. The new aspects of this study highlighted pioneer findings that correlated the degree of tissue parasite density (low (LP), medium (MP) and high (HP) parasitism) with distinct patterns of anti-Leishmania Igs reactivity. In this scope, our data re-enforce the anti-Leishmania IgG but with IgA reactivity as the better marker for overall tissue parasitism. The association between clinical status, Ig profile and the tissue parasitism support a novel investigation on the impact of humoral immune response and susceptibility/resistance mechanism during ongoing CVL.},

Innovative and adaptable training programs and resources are essential in this regard as both disciplines promise to be key elements of the clinical research workplace of the future. The demand for scientists with pharmacometrics skills has risen substantially. Likewise, the salary garnered by those with these skills appears to be surpassing their counterparts without such backgrounds. Given the paucity of existing training programs, available training materials, and academic champions, a virtual faculty and online curriculum would allow students to matriculate into one of several programs associated with their advisor but take instruction from faculty at multiple institutions, including instructors in both industrial and regulatory settings.

At this time, there is a lack of useful alternative classes of substances for the treatment of invasive amoebiasis. Alkylphosphocholines (alkyl-PCs) such as hexadecyl-PC (miltefosine) were originally developed as antitumor agents, but recently they have been successfully used for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in humans. We examined hexadecyl-PC and several other alkyl-PCs with longer alkyl chains, with and without double bond(s), for their activity against two strains of E. histolytica. The compounds with the highest activity were oleyl-PC, octadecyl-PC, and nonadecenyl-PC, with 50\% effective concentrations for 48 h of treatment between 15 and 21 microM for strain SFL-3 and between 73 and 98 microM for strain HM-1:IMSS. We also tested liposomal formulations of these alkyl-PCs and miltefosine. The alkyl-PC liposomes showed slightly lower activity, but are expected to be well tolerated. Liposomal formulations of oleyl-PC or closely related alkyl-PCs could be promising candidates for testing as broad-spectrum antiprotozoal and antitumor agents in humans.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

To overcome some of the limitations of conventional microbiologic techniques, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays are proposed as useful tools for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis.


PATIENTS AND METHODS

A comparative study using conventional microbiologic techniques (i.e., serologic testing, microscopic examination, and culture) and a Leishmania species-specific PCR assay, using peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate samples as templates, was conducted during an 8-year period. The study cohort consisted of 594 Italian immunocompetent (adult and pediatric) and immunocompromised (adult) patients experiencing febrile syndromes associated with hematologic alterations and/or hepatosplenomegaly. Identification of the infecting protozoa at the species level was directly obtained by PCR of peripheral blood samples, followed by restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis of the amplified products, and the results were compared with those of isoenzyme typing of Leishmania species strains from patients, which were isolated in vitro.


RESULTS

Sixty-eight patients (11.4\%) had a confirmed diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis. Eleven cases were observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-uninfected adults, 20 cases were observed in HIV-infected adults, and the remaining 37 cases were diagnosed in HIV-uninfected children. In the diagnosis of primary visceral leishmaniasis, the sensitivities of the Leishmania species-specific PCR were 95.7\% for bone marrow aspirate samples and 98.5\% for peripheral blood samples versus sensitivities of 76.2\%, 85.5\%, and 90.2\% for bone marrow aspirate isolation, serologic testing, and microscopic examination of bone marrow biopsy specimens, respectively. None of 229 healthy blood donors or 25 patients with imported malaria who were used as negative control subjects had PCR results positive for Leishmania species in peripheral blood samples (i.e., specificity of Leishmania species-specific PCR, 100\%). PCR and restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis for Leishmania species identification revealed 100\% concordance with isoenzyme typing in the 19 patients for whom the latter data were available.


CONCLUSIONS

PCR assay is a highly sensitive and specific tool for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients and can be reliably used for rapid parasite identification at the species level.},

The treatment and control of schistosomiasis, a notable neglected tropical disease (NTD), rely on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). The dependency on PZQ exclusively is quite alarming, given the spread of the disease (over 200 million people infected and close to 800 million people at risk in three continents) and the threat of drug resistance. This study shows that the oral administration of miltefosine in a daily dose of 20mg/kg for five successive days to mice infected with either invasive, juvenile or adult stages of Schistosoma mansoni resulted in significant reduction of worm burden, hepatic granulomata size and amelioration of hepatic pathology. Scanning Electron Microscopy revealed that miltefosine induced severe tegumental damage in adult schistosomes. In conclusion, we believe this is the first study highlighting miltefosine as a promising novel agent for schistosomiasis mansoni.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent reports indicated high miltefosine treatment failure rates for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) on the Indian subcontinent. To further explore the pharmacological factors associated with these treatment failures, a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study was performed to examine the relationship between miltefosine drug exposure and treatment failure in a cohort of Nepalese patients with VL.
METHODS: Miltefosine steady-state blood concentrations at the end of treatment were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling and a logistic regression model. Individual estimates of miltefosine exposure were explored for their relationship with treatment failure.
RESULTS: The overall probability of treatment failure was 21\%. The time that the blood concentration was {\textgreater}10 times the half maximal effective concentration of miltefosine (median, 30.2 days) was significantly associated with treatment failure: each 1-day decrease in miltefosine exposure was associated with a 1.08-fold (95\% confidence interval, 1.01-1.17) increased odds of treatment failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Achieving a sufficient exposure to miltefosine is a significant and critical factor for VL treatment success, suggesting an urgent need to evaluate the recently proposed optimal allometric miltefosine dosing regimen. This study establishes the first evidence for a drug exposure-effect relationship for miltefosine in the treatment of VL.},

This article describes the preclinical profile of fexinidazole, a new drug candidate with the potential to become a novel, oral, safe and effective short-course treatment for curing both stage 1 and 2 human African trypanosomiasis and replace the old and highly problematic treatment modalities available today. Fexinidazole is orally available and rapidly metabolized in two metabolites having equivalent biological activity to the parent and contributing significantly to the  in vivo  efficacy in animal models of both stage 1 and 2 HAT. Animal toxicology studies indicate that fexinidazole has an excellent safety profile, with no particular issues identified. Fexinidazole is a 5-nitroimidazole and, whilst it is Ames-positive, it is devoid of any genetic toxicity in mammalian cells and therefore does not pose a genotoxic risk for use in man. Fexinidazole, which was rediscovered through a process of compound mining, is the first new drug candidate for stage 2 HAT having entered clinical trials in thirty years, and has the potential to revolutionize therapy of this fatal disease at a cost that is acceptable in the endemic regions.},

	volume = {95 Suppl 1},
	issn = {0035-9203},
	abstract = {From the early 1900s, visceral leishmaniasis (VL; kala-azar) has been among the most important health problems in Sudan, particularly in the main endemic area in the eastern and central regions. Several major epidemics have occurred, the most recent--in Western Upper Nile province in southern Sudan, detected in 1988--claiming over 100,000 lives. The disease spread to other areas that were previously not known to be endemic for VL. A major upsurge in the number of cases was noted in the endemic area. These events triggered renewed interest in the disease. Epidemiological and entomological studies confirmed Phlebotomus orientalis as the vector in several parts of the country, typically associated with Acacia seyal and Balanites aegyptiaca vegetation. Infection rates with Leishmania were high, but subject to seasonal variation, as were the numbers of sand flies. Parasites isolated from humans and sand flies belonged to three zymodemes (MON-18, MON-30 and MON-82), which all belong to the L. donovani sensu lato cluster. Transmission dynamics have not been elucidated fully; heavy transmission in relatively scarcely populated areas such as Dinder national park suggested zoonotic transmission whereas the large numbers of patients with post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) in heavily affected villages may indicate a human reservoir and anthroponotic transmission. Clinical presentation in adults and in children did not differ significantly, except that children were more anaemic. Fever, weight loss, hepato-splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy were the most common findings. PKDL was much more common than expected (56\% of patients with VL developed PKDL), but other post-VL manifestations were also found affecting the eyes (uveitis, conjunctivitis, blepharitis), nasal and/or oral mucosa. Evaluation of diagnostic methods showed that parasitological diagnosis should still be the mainstay in diagnosis, with sensitivities for lymph node, bone marrow and spleen aspirates of 58\%, 70\% and 96\%, respectively. Simple, cheap serological tests are needed. The direct agglutination test (DAT) had a sensitivity of 72\%, specificity of 94\%, positive predictive value of 78\% and negative predictive value of 92\%. As with other serological tests, the DAT cannot distinguish between active disease, subclinical infection or past infection. The introduction of freeze-dried antigen and control sera greatly improved the practicality and accuracy of the DAT in the field. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant K39 antigen had higher sensitivity than DAT (93\%). The polymerase chain reaction using peripheral blood gave a sensitivity of 70-93\% and was more sensitive than microscopy of lymph node or bone marrow aspirates in patients with suspected VL. The leishmanin skin test (LST) was typically negative during active VL and converted to positive in c. 80\% of patients 6 months after treatment. Immunological studies showed that both Th1 and Th2 cell responses could be demonstrated in lymph nodes from VL patients as evidenced by the presence of messenger ribonucleic acid for interleukin (IL)-10, interferon gamma and IL-2. Treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from VL patients with IL-12 was found to drive the immune response toward a Th1 type response with the production of interferon gamma, indicating a potential therapeutic role for IL-12. VL responded well to treatment with sodium stibogluconate, which is still the first line drug at a dose of 20 mg/kg intravenously or intramuscularly per day for 15-30 d. Side effects and resistance were rare. Liposomal amphotericin B was effective, with few side effects. Control measures have not been implemented. Based on observations that VL does not occur in individuals who have a positive LST, probably because of previous cutaneous leishmaniasis, a vaccine containing heat-killed L. major promastigotes is currently undergoing a phase III trial.},

Complete clinical response was defined as 100\% re-epithelialization of the lesion. Definitions of lesion cure and failure were based on both clinical and parasitological criteria two weeks after the end of treatment and clinical recovery three months after this period. Of 32 patients enrolled for miltefosine treatment 28 patients completed treatment, of which 26 were cured at three months, corresponding to a cure rate of 92.9\% on a per protocol analysis, and 81.3\% according to intention to treat analysis. There was one failure (3.1\%), one relapse (3.1\%) and four dropouts due to lack of tolerability (12.5\%) during the first week of treatment. Of 31 patients who received intramuscular meglumine antimoniate (20mgSb(5)/kg body weight daily for 14 days) 25 were cured (83.3\% on a per protocol basis, 80.6\% on intention to treat basis), five failed (16.1\%) and one was lost (3.2\%) at 3-month follow-up. At 6-month follow-up after the end of treatment, no relapse was observed. Both regimens were tolerated but averages of nausea (32.2\%) and vomiting (21.5\%) were observed in patients during two weeks after initiation of miltefosine treatment. Other gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and total adverse events were not statistically different in the two groups during one to four weeks after therapy initiation. No relevant changes were observed in levels of liver enzymes, creatinine and hematological tests before and after end of treatment in both groups. In conclusion, miltefosine is apparently at least as good as meglumine antimoniate for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. major in Iran, based on parasitological as well as clinical criteria two weeks, three months, and six months after end of treatment.},

	abstract = {Amastin surface proteins belong to a large family of developmentally regulated proteins comprising up to 45 members that have recently been discovered in the genus Leishmania and are highly similar to the amastin proteins in Trypanosoma cruzi. All members of the amastin gene family contain a highly conserved 11-amino-acid (aa) signature at the N terminus, which is unique to the amastin proteins and to the Trypanosomatidae family. Recent studies have demonstrated that this region is highly protective in a mouse model. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the potential of the 50-aa N-terminal domain of amastin proteins harboring the conserved 11-aa amastin signature peptide as a relevant immune biomarker of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL). We report here the amastin-binding total immunoglobulins (IgG) and/or IgG subclasses in the sera of patients at different stages of CL (n=90) and VL (n=41). In CL cases, there is no significant difference in seroreactivities between active, recovered, and nonhealed cases. However, the amastin peptide-reactive antibodies were present at high titers in 19 of 20 sera collected from patients with active VL compared to sera from patients recovered from VL and asymptomatic cases of VL. These data suggest that the amastin signature peptide could represent a relevant biomarker for the serodiagnosis of VL and, most importantly, that it could permit differentiation among the different stages of the disease.},

By reviewing papers published during the period January 2000–January 2010, this paper discusses recent developments with respect to methodology, applications, and lessons learned in the use of CTS in the development and clinical use of specific drugs. It is expected that future CTS experiments will be aided by the hybridization of optimal design methods with computationally intensive stochastic simulations.

	abstract = {Only anecdotal data are available on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of miltefosine in children suffering from visceral leishmaniasis (VL). While failure rates were higher in children with VL, steady-state concentrations appeared lower than those seen with adults. We hypothesized that the current linear dosage (in milligrams per kilogram of body weight) is too low for children and that a new dosing algorithm based on an appropriate body size model would result in an optimal exposure. A population PK analysis was performed on three historic pooled data sets, including Indian children, Indian adults, and European adults. Linear and allometric scaling of PK parameters by either body weight or fat-free mass (FFM) was evaluated for body size models. Based on the developed PK model, a dosing algorithm for miltefosine in children and adults was proposed and evaluated in silico. The population PK model employing allometric scaling fitted best to the pooled miltefosine data. Allometric scaling by FFM reduced between-subject variability, e.g., for drug clearance, from 49.6\% to 32.1\%. A new allometric miltefosine dosing algorithm was proposed. Exposure to miltefosine was lower in children than adults receiving 2.5 mg/kg/day: a C(max) of 18.8 μg/ml was reached by 90\% of adults and 66.7\% of children. The allometric daily dose resulted in similar levels of exposure to miltefosine for adults and children. The use of a new allometric dosing algorithm for miltefosine in VL patients results in optimal exposure to miltefosine in both adults and children and might improve clinical outcome in children.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

There are 500,000 cases per year of visceral leishmaniasis, which occurs primarily in the Indian subcontinent. Almost all untreated patients die, and all the effective agents have been parenteral. Miltefosine is an oral agent that has been shown in small numbers of patients to have a favorable therapeutic index for Indian visceral leishmaniasis. We performed a clinical trial in India comparing miltefosine with the most effective standard treatment, amphotericin B.


METHODS

The study was a randomized, open-label comparison, in which 299 patients 12 years of age or older received orally administered miltefosine (50 or 100 mg [approximately 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight] daily for 28 days) and 99 patients received intravenously administered amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram every other day for a total of 15 injections).


RESULTS

The groups were well matched in terms of age, weight, proportion with previous failure of treatment for leishmaniasis, parasitologic grade of splenic aspirate, and splenomegaly. At the end of treatment, splenic aspirates were obtained from 293 patients in the miltefosine group and 98 patients in the amphotericin B group. No parasites were identified, for an initial cure rate of 100 percent. By six months after the completion of treatment, 282 of the 299 patients in the miltefosine group (94 percent [95 percent confidence interval, 91 to 97]) and 96 of the 99 patients in the amphotericin B group (97 percent) had not had a relapse; these patients were classified as cured. Vomiting and diarrhea, generally lasting one to two days, occurred in 38 percent and 20 percent of the patients in the miltefosine group, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS

Oral miltefosine is an effective and safe treatment for Indian visceral leishmaniasis. Miltefosine may be particularly advantageous because it can be administered orally. It may also be helpful in regions where parasites are resistant to current agents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Although mucosal leishmaniasis is a prominent disease, it has been studied only to a limited extent. It is classically treated with parenteral antimony or, as a last resort, amphotericin B.


METHODS

We treated Bolivian mucosal leishmaniasis due to Leishmania braziliensis with the oral agent miltefosine, 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days, and followed-up for 12 months.


RESULTS

Seventy-two patients were evaluable. The cure rate for the 36 patients who had "mild" disease (i.e., affecting nasal skin and nasal mucosa) was 83\%. The cure rate for the 36 patients who had more extensive disease (involving the palate, pharynx, and larynx) was 58\%. Patients refused to be randomized to parenteral agents, but the cure rate for an almost contemporary group who was receiving amphotericin B (45 mg/kg over 90 days) was 7 (50\%) of 14.


CONCLUSIONS

In this unrandomized trial, oral miltefosine was at least as effective as heroic doses of parenteral amphotericin B. The cure rate for miltefosine was approximately equivalent to historical cure rates using parenteral pentavalent antimony for mild and extensive disease in neighboring Peru. Although gastrointestinal side reactions do occur with miltefosine, its toxicity profile is superior to that of antimony and far superior to that of amphotericin B--in part because of the inherent attractiveness of oral versus parenteral agents. Our results suggest that miltefosine should be the treatment of choice for mucosal disease in North and South America.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

The search for a correlation between chemokine levels in plasma or serum and protection from HIV infection or progression to AIDS has been attempted by a number of workers. Chemokines are also suggested to play a role in immunity to Leishmania and Leishmania co-infection with HIV.


OBJECTIVE

To assess plasma level of alpha chemokine (CXCL12, formerly known as SDF-1alpha) and beta chemokines (CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5, formerly known as MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta and RANTES, respectively) in HIV Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) and HIV/VL coinfection.


METHODS

Frozen serum samples from a cross sectional study were used. The samples (n = 80) were comprised of healthy controls (n = 20), HIV patients (n = 20); Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) patients (n = 22), and HIV/VL coinfected patients (n = 18). Chemokine levels of MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, RANTES, and SDF-1alpha of the serum samples were determined using ELISA.


RESULTS

MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta expression were significantly elevated in Leishmania infected (p {\textless} 0.001) and in HIV/ VL co-infected individuals (p {\textless} 0.001) as compared to the control groups, while no significant difference was seen between HIV infected patients p {\textgreater} 0.05, implying that VL alone might modulate the production of these two chemokines in the case of co-infection In RANTES, however, its expression was significantly higher in HIV patients compared to controls (p = 0.002). Further assessment of serum RANTES concentration in HIV patients has shown a tendency of negative association with viral load. Higher amount of the alpha chemokine, SDF-1alpha, was detected in the HIV patients (p = 0.001) than the control group. Also a trend of positive association between SDF-1alpha and CD4 count was observed


CONCLUSION

From our data we can speculate that RANTES and SDF-1alpha might be involved in the regulation of HIV; and MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta in VL. Therefore, enhancing or suppressing the production of these chemokines might help in therapeutic intervention of VL or HIV.},

The development of drug resistance is a major problem and threatens control efforts under the VL elimination initiative. With an unprecedented choice of antileishmanial drugs (but no newer compound in clinical development), policies that protect these drugs against the emergence of resistance are required. A possible strategy that has been successfully used for malaria and tuberculosis is the use of combination therapies. This study is the first comprehensive assessment of the cost-effectiveness of all possible mono- and combination therapies for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in the Indian subcontinent. The analysis was done from the societal perspective, including both health provider and household costs. The present work shows that combination treatments are a cost-effective alternative to current monotherapy for VL. Given their expected impact on emergence of drug resistance, the use of combination therapy should be considered in the context of the VL elimination programme in the Indian subcontinent.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and corticosteroids are commonly prescribed drugs; however, each has been associated with fracture and community-acquired pneumonia. How physicians select patients for co-therapy may have implications for potential additive or synergistic toxicities.


METHODS

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 13 749 incident corticosteroid users with no prior PPI exposure using the HealthCore Integrated Research Database(SM) . We used logistic regression to evaluate the association between PPI initiation in the first 30 days of steroid therapy and corticosteroid dose, clinical risk factors including comorbid diseases, and medication use including prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).


RESULTS

A new PPI prescription within 30 days of starting corticosteroids was filled by 1050 patients (7.6\%). PPI use was associated with the number of baseline comorbid conditions (OR = 1.21 for each additional condition, 95\%CI = 1.13-1.28), recent hospitalization (OR = 4.71, 95\%CI = 4.02-5.52), prednisone dose higher than 40 mg/day (OR = 1.87, 95\%CI = 1.45-2.41), history of gastroesophageal reflux or gastric ulcer disease (OR = 1.54, 95\%CI = 1.24-1.91), renal insufficiency (OR = 2.06, 95\%CI = 1.73-2.46), and liver disease (OR = 1.82, 95\%CI = 1.45-2.28). The concomitant use of prescription NSAIDs was also associated with PPI use (OR = 1.89, 95\%CI = 1.32-2.70); however, the total use of PPIs in this group was low (6.3\%, 95\%CI = 4.4-8.2\%).


CONCLUSIONS

Overall, PPI therapy among corticosteroid users was uncommon, even among those with risk factors for gastrointestinal toxicity. PPI use was significantly more common among patients who had recently been hospitalized, had a greater burden of comorbid illness, or were receiving high daily doses of corticosteroids.

This study aimed to evaluate neopterin, a marker of macrophage activation, as possible pharmacodynamic biomarker to monitor VL treatment response and to predict long-term clinical relapse of VL. Following informed consent, 497 plasma samples were collected from East-African VL patients receiving a 28-day miltefosine monotherapy (48 patients) or 11-day combination therapy of miltefosine and liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB, 48 patients). Neopterin was quantified with ELISA. Values are reported as median (inter-quartile range). Baseline neopterin concentrations were elevated in all VL patients at 98.8 (63.9-135) nmol/L compared to reported levels for healthy controls ({\textless}10 nmol/L). During the first treatment week, concentrations remained stable in monotherapy patients (p = 0.807), but decreased two-fold compared to baseline in the combination therapy patients (p {\textless} 0.01). In the combination therapy arm, neopterin concentrations increased significantly 1 day after L-AMB infusion compared to baseline for cured patients [137 (98.5-197) nmol/L, p {\textless} 0.01], but not for relapsing patients [84.4 (68.9-106) nmol/L, p = 0.96]. The neopterin parameter with the highest predictive power for VL relapse was a higher than 8\% neopterin concentration increase between end of treatment and day 60 follow-up (ROC AUC 0.84), with a 93\% sensitivity and 65\% specificity. In conclusion, the identified neopterin parameter could be a potentially useful surrogate endpoint to identify patients in clinical trials at risk of relapse earlier during follow-up, possibly in a panel of biomarkers to increase its specificity.},

Dexamethasone treatment in the current doses did not produce mucosal damage in intact animals. However, the drug dose-dependently delayed gastric ulcer healing. It also decreased mucus content and epithelial cell proliferation at the ulcer margin as well as angiogenesis at the ulcer margin and base. These were associated with a significant decrease of COX-2 expression and PGE2 level but not COX-1 at the ulcer margin. The drug only marginally reduced the cPLA2 expression without affecting the apoptosis at the ulcer margin. PGE2 treatment reversed the adverse effects of dexamethasone on ulcer healing. It is concluded that nonulcerogenic doses of dexamethasone can delay ulcer repair via depression of COX-2 expression and PGE2 formation in the gastric mucosa.},

As part of a study on the mechanisms of action of this drug and on the rates of resistance to this drug, we have been working in vitro with an Leishmania donovani line that was previously shown to be 15-fold more resistant to HePC. We have studied the accumulation of [(14)C]HePC by L. donovani promastigotes and have found a drastic reduction ({\textgreater}95\%) in the ability of the resistant line to internalize the drug. Binding of HePC to the plasma membrane and drug efflux from preloaded cells were similar in both drug-sensitive and -resistant lines, and no [(14)C]HePC metabolism was evident in either line. Resistant parasites were also unable to take up other short-chain phospholipid analogs, independently of their polar head group, even though endocytosis remained unaltered. Finally, HePC uptake was temperature and energy dependent and sensitive to the thiol-reactive agent N-ethylmaleimide. We propose that inward translocation of a short-chain phospholipid across the plasma membrane may exist in Leishmania promastigotes and that such activity is defective in the resistant line.},

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: *Effects of size, renal function, age (postnatal age, gestational age and postmenstrual age) as predictors of vancomycin clearance in premature neonates are established, but the relative contribution of each component remains poorly quantified, largely because these variables are closely correlated. *We have quantified the covariates contributing to vancomycin clearance population parameter variability in order to establish the major covariates required for dosing predictions. Size, standardized using allometric models, was the primary covariate used in our analysis.


WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS

*Size explained 49.8\%, postmenstrual age 18.2\% and renal function 14.1\% of clearance variability. *Descriptors of the relationship between age and clearance in premature neonates vary. *The use of a variable slope sigmoidal model to describe the relationship between clearance and postmenstrual age predicted an adult clearance of 3.79 l h(-1) 70 kg(-1) (95\% confidence interval 2.76, 4.98) from premature neonatal data.


AIM

To identify and quantify factors describing the variability of vancomycin clearance in premature neonates.


METHODS

Population pharmacokinetics were estimated (NONMEM) in 214 neonates [postmenstrual age (PMA) 30.4 weeks, range 24-34 weeks; postnatal age 11.9 days, range 1-27 days; weight 1.30 kg, range 0.42-2.6 kg] using therapeutic drug monitoring data. Covariate analysis included weight, PMA, serum creatinine, use of inotropes or ibuprofen, positive blood culture and respiratory support. A one-compartment linear disposition model with zero order input and first-order elimination was used to describe the data (604 observations).


RESULTS

The population estimate for volume of distribution (V) was 39 l 70 kg(-1) (coefficient of variation 19.4\%). Clearance (CL) increased from 0.897 l h(-1) 70 kg(-1) at 24 weeks PMA to 2.02 l h(-1) 70 kg(-1) by 34 weeks PMA. The between-subject variability for CL was 18.6\% and the between-occasion variability was 12.2\%. The use of ibuprofen reduced clearance, but this effect was attributable to reduced renal function. Overall, 82\% of the variability of CL was predictable. Size explained 49.8\%, PMA 18.2\% and renal function 14.1\%. The use of a variable slope sigmoidal model to describe the relationship between clearance and PMA predicted an adult clearance of 3.79 l h(-1) 70 kg(-1) (95\% confidence interval 2.76, 4.98).


CONCLUSIONS

Size, renal function and PMA are the major contributors to clearance variability in premature neonates. The small (18\%) unexplained variability in clearance suggests target concentration intervention is unnecessary if size, age and renal function are used to predict the dose. Extrapolation to an adult clearance from neonatal data is possible using allometric size models and a function describing clearance maturation.},

Here, we report that fexinidazole, a drug currently in phase 1 clinical trials for treating African trypanosomiasis, shows promise for treating visceral leishmaniasis. This 2-substituted 5-nitroimidazole drug is rapidly oxidized in vivo in mice, dogs, and humans to sulfoxide and sulfone metabolites. Both metabolites of fexinidazole were active against Leishmania donovani amastigotes grown in macrophages, whereas the parent compound was inactive. Pharmacokinetic studies with fexinidazole (200 mg/kg) showed that fexinidazole sulfone achieves blood concentrations in mice above the EC(99) (effective concentration inhibiting growth by 99\%) value for at least 24 hours after a single oral dose. A once-daily regimen for 5 days at this dose resulted in a 98.4\% suppression of infection in a mouse model of visceral leishmaniasis, equivalent to that seen with the drugs miltefosine and Pentostam, which are currently used clinically to treat this tropical disease. In African trypanosomes, the mode of action of nitro drugs involves reductive activation via a NADH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)-dependent bacterial-like nitroreductase. Overexpression of the leishmanial homolog of this nitroreductase in L. donovani increased sensitivity to fexinidazole by 19-fold, indicating that a similar mechanism is involved in both parasites. These findings illustrate the potential of fexinidazole as an oral drug therapy for treating visceral leishmaniasis.},

The CS was compared to blood samples (B) and skin biopsies (SB), two less invasive samples potentially useful for massive screening of dogs. Thirty asymptomatic dogs, with serological and parasitological positive tests, were used. The samples were analyzed by two PCR methods: kDNA PCR-hybridization and ITS-1 nPCR. The DNA sample volume used was of 1.0 microL and 10.0 microL respectively. Using CS samples the kDNA PCR-hybridization was able to detected parasite DNA in 24/30 dogs (80\%) using the right conjunctiva (RC) and 23/30 dogs (76.6\%) with the left conjunctiva (LC), 17/30 dogs (56.7\%) by means of SB and 4/30 dogs (13.3\%) with B. The CS positivity obtained combining RC and LC results was of 90\% (27/30 dogs). The assay of CS samples by ITS-1 nPCR revealed that 25/30 dogs (83.3\%) were positive when using RC and 20/30 dogs (66.6\%) were positive when using LC. Via the same method 15/30 dogs (50.0\%) were positive by SB and 17/30 dogs (56.7\%) with B. The CS positivity obtained by ITS-1 nPCR combining RC and LC was of 83.3\%. The CS positivities for RC and LC were significantly higher (p{\textless}0.05) than SB and B for kDNA PCR-hybridization method. Statistical difference in relation to SB and B was verified by ITS-1 nPCR only for RC. The kDNA PCR-hybridization and ITS-1 nPCR methods showed similar sensitivities for CS and SB samples. On the other hand, for blood samples, the positivity of ITS-1 nPCR was significantly higher than the one obtained by the kDNA PCR-hybridization, indicating that sensitivity of PCR methods can vary according to the biological sample examined. Our results showed that CS was suitable to detect Leishmania DNA in asymptomatic animals when comparing to other low-invasive samples. The CS sensitivities obtained in this study were similar to the ones observed in other studies for VL diagnosis in symptomatic dogs. We concluded that the use of CS for regular screenings of dogs by PCR should be considered.},

	abstract = {A rapid and accurate method to detect and quantify Leishmania parasite is urgently needed to facilitate early diagnosis of leishmaniasis and monitoring of antileishmania therapy. In this study, real-time assay was applied to estimate parasite load in clinical samples of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) patients. The mean parasite load in blood of VL patients (n = 31) was 8,372 parasites/ml, while the mean parasite load in bone marrow aspirate (BMA) was 194,962 parasites/million nucleated cells (n = 12). Parasite load was undetectable after treatment with amphotericin B (n = 9) in VL, while a residual parasite burden was detected in 2 of 6 patients following treatment with sodium antimony gluconate. Further, circulating levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-10, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2 were analysed in VL patients (n = 29) by Cytometric Bead Array to evaluate correlation with parasitic load. Interestingly, IL-10 levels correlated significantly with parasite load (r = 0.82, P{\textless}0.0001). The mean parasite load in dermal lesions of PKDL patients was 9,502 parasites/microg tissue DNA at pre-treatment stage (n = 25), with no detectable parasites after therapy (n = 5). Parasite burden was distinctly higher (P{\textless}0.0001) in nodular lesions (n = 12) (19,586 parasites/microg tissue DNA) compared to papular/macular lesions (n = 13, 193 parasites/microg tissue DNA). Further, chronic PKDL lesions showed significantly (P = 0.0166) higher parasite load in comparison with acute lesions. Results indicate that chronic, nodular cases constitute the major parasite reservoir for anthroponotic transmission. Our results establish that the high parasite load in VL is strongly correlated with a high level of IL-10, implicating IL-10 as a marker of disease severity. The assay is applicable for diagnosis as well as prognosis of both VL and PKDL, providing a simple molecular tool to monitor the efficacy of antileishmanial drugs or vaccines.},

In all cases, chemotherapy was able to restore these frequencies to normal levels. Interestingly, significant differences in the frequency of CD18 and in the frequency of CD45RO-positive cells were observed in the CD8+ T cell subset. These two frequencies were also significantly higher in bone marrow when compared with peripheral blood, suggesting a possible compartmentalization of certain CD8+ T cell populations during active disease.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis is a systemic parasitic disease that is fatal unless treated. We assessed the cost and cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in the Indian subcontinent. In particular we examined whether combination therapies are a cost-effective alternative compared to monotherapies.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of all possible mono- and combination therapies for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in the Indian subcontinent (India, Nepal and Bangladesh) from a societal perspective using a decision analytical model based on a decision tree. Primary data collected in each country was combined with data from the literature and an expert poll (Delphi method). The cost per patient treated and average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios expressed as cost per death averted were calculated. Extensive sensitivity analysis was done to evaluate the robustness of our estimations and conclusions. With a cost of US\$92 per death averted, the combination miltefosine-paromomycin was the most cost-effective treatment strategy. The next best alternative was a combination of liposomal amphotericin B with paromomycin with an incremental cost-effectiveness of \$652 per death averted. All other strategies were dominated with the exception of a single dose of 10mg per kg of liposomal amphotericin B. While strategies based on liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) were found to be the most effective, its current drug cost of US\$20 per vial resulted in a higher average cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analysis showed the conclusion to be robust to variations in the input parameters over their plausible range.
CONCLUSIONS: Combination treatments are a cost-effective alternative to current monotherapy for VL. Given their expected impact on the emergence of drug resistance, a switch to combination therapy should be considered once final results from clinical trials are available.},

Therefore, the anti-neoplastic activity of 4 alkylphosphocholines (APCs) was compared in 6 tumor cell lines in vitro and in MNU-induced rat mammary carcinoma in vivo. The in vitro system consisted of 2 rat mammary-carcinoma-derived cell lines (1/C2 and 1/C32), as well as 2 human mammary-gland (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7)- and gastrointestinal tract (HT-29 and KB)-derived tumor cell lines. As assessed by both cell counting and MTT-assay, the ranking of concentrations effecting 50\% growth inhibition (IC50) was parallel in all cell lines for octadecylphosphocholine (18:0-PC), octadecenyl-(trans-9.10)-phosphocholine (t-18:1-PC) and octadecenyl-(cis-9.10)-phosphocholine (c-18:1-PC). Only hexadecylphosphocholine (16:0-PC) differed in its activity, being least active in 1/C2, 1/C32 and MDA-MB-231 cells, moderately active in KB and MCF-7 cells, and most active in HT-29 cells. The IC50 concentrations of APCs in the 2 rat mammary carcinoma cell lines significantly correlated with dosages effecting a 50\% tumor growth delay in vivo. Remarkably, the 2 gastrointestinal cell lines were more sensitive to APC exposure than the mammary-carcinoma cell lines. In all cell lines except KB cells, growth-stimulation effects were seen in the concentration range preceding the anti-proliferative activity; in vivo, however, no accelerated cancer growth was observed. The in vitro system failed to describe the superior therapeutic ratio of c-18:1-PC, as assessed in vivo, because it does not take the relative sensitivity of tumor vs. normal cells into account. Complementary in vivo trials are therefore indispensable for a final evaluation. Comparison of the 2 in vitro assays shows good agreement of the interrelationship of IC50 values, those obtained by MTT assay being on average 25\% higher than those obtained from cell counting.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Two major cities in West Africa, Accra, the capital of Ghana, and Lagos, the largest city of Nigeria, have significant problems with substandard pharmaceuticals. Both have actively combated the problem in recent years, particularly by screening products on the market using the Global Pharma Health Fund e.V. Minilab protocol. Random sampling of medicines from the two cities at least twice over the past 30 months allows a tentative assessment of whether improvements in drug quality have occurred. Since intelligence provided by investigators indicates that some counterfeit producers may be adapting products to pass Minilab tests, the results are compared with those from a Raman spectrometer and discrepancies are discussed.


METHODS

Between mid-2007 and early-2010, samples of anti-malarial drugs were bought covertly from pharmacies in Lagos on three different occasions (October 2007, December 2008, February 2010), and from pharmacies in Accra on two different occasions (October 2007, February 2010). All samples were tested using the Minilab protocol, which includes disintegration and active ingredient assays as well as visual inspection, and most samples were also tested by Raman spectrometry.


RESULTS

In Lagos, the failure rate in the 2010 sampling fell to 29\% of the 2007 finding using the Minilab protocol, 53\% using Raman spectrometry, and 46\% using visual inspection. In Accra, the failure rate in the 2010 sampling fell to 54\% of the 2007 finding using the Minilab protocol, 72\% using Raman spectrometry, and 90\% using visual inspection.


CONCLUSIONS

The evidence presented shows that drug quality is probably improving in both cities, especially Lagos, since major reductions of failure rates over time occur with all means of assessment. Many more samples failed when examined by Raman spectrometry than by Minilab protocol. The discrepancy is most likely caused by the two techniques measuring different aspects of the medication and hence the discrepancy may be the natural variation in these techniques. But other explanations are possible and are discussed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES

To assess the prevalence of counterfeit anthelminthic medicines in Cambodia, and to determine influential factors.


METHODS

Commonly used anthelminthic medicines were collected from private drug outlets. Medicines were carefully observed including their registration labelling, and their authenticity was investigated with the manufacturers and the Medicines Regulatory Authorities. Samples were analysed by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography at the National Health Product Quality Control Centre, Cambodia.


RESULTS

Two hundred and three samples of anthelminthics were collected from 137 drug stores. Domestic products constituted 36.9\%. Of 196 samples which were verified for registration, 15.8\% were not registered. Of 165 samples successfully investigated for their authenticity, 7 (4.2\%) were identified as counterfeit. All of these medicines were purchased in open packs or containers, and most of them were foreign manufactured and/or without registration.


CONCLUSION

The results of our survey urge strict implementation of drug registration and vigilance on the availability of unregistered medicines to combat counterfeit medicines in Cambodia.},

Sensitivity and specificity with 95\% credible intervals were estimated using Bayesian latent class analysis. On the Indian subcontinent both the FD-DAT and the rK39 strip test exceeded the 95\% sensitivity and 90\% specificity target, but not so in East Africa. Sensitivity of the FD-DAT was high in Ethiopia and Kenya but lower in Sudan, while its specificity was below 90\% in Kenya. Sensitivity of the rK39 was below 80\% in the three countries, and its specificity was only 70\% in Ethiopia. KAtex showed moderate to very low sensitivity in all countries. FD-DAT and rK39 can be recommended for clinical practice on the Indian subcontinent. In East Africa, their clinical use should be carefully monitored.

Ten large and mid-sized pharmaceutical companies provided responses to this survey. The results indicate that MBDD is achieving broad application in early and late development and is positively affecting both internal and regulatory decisions. Senior leadership (vice president and higher) within the companies indicated widely accepted utility for dose selection and gaining acceptance for study design and regulatory interactions but limited acceptance in discovery and commercial/pipeline decisions.

All 1,737 ACAs contained the labeled artemisinin derivative, with 4.1\% being outside the 85–115\% artemisinin API range defined as acceptable quality. World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified drugs had 0.1 times the odds of being poor quality compared with non-prequalified ACAs for the artemisinin component. When partner components of combination therapies were also considered, 12.1\% were outside the acceptable API range, and WHO prequalified ACAs had 0.04 times the odds of being poor quality. Although the prevalence of poor quality ACAs was lower than reported elsewhere, the minority of samples found to be substandard is a cause for concern. Improvements in quality could be achieved by increasing the predominance of WHO prequalified products in the market. Continued monitoring of quality standards is essential.},

	abstract = {High cost is the principal drawback of treating visceral leishmaniasis (VL; kala-azar) with any of the new lipid formulations of amphotericin B. The aim of the present study was to see if the costs of treatment with such drugs could be reduced by using ultra-short courses. Amphotericin-B-lipid complex (ABLC) was given to 77 Indian patients with antimony-unresponsive VL, either as a single infusion of 5 mg/kg (Group A) or two infusions, each of 5 mg/kg, given 5 days apart (Group B) or on consecutive days (Group C). Other than the anticipated higher fever and chills, treatment was well-tolerated. On day 19 after first infusion, 72 patients were considered apparent cures: 24 (89\%) of the 27 in Group A; all 24 (100\%) in Group B; and 24 (92\%) of the 26 patients in Group C. Six months after treatment, 19 (70\%) of 27 in Group A, 19 (79\%) of 24 in Group B, and 21 (81\%) of 26 in Group C were healthy, relapse-free and considered definitive cures. These cure rates were not statistically different. All 18 treatment failures (five initial non-responders and 13 relapses) were cured after treatment with a 5-day course of ABLC at a higher dose (10-15 mg/kg.day). In a related analysis of hospital plus drug costs for treating antimony-unresponsive VL, short-course ABLC (1-5 days) was compared with conventional amphotericin B (0.75-1.0 mg/kg on alternate days over 30-34 days). This analysis, which included the cost of re-treatment, identified one short-course ABLC regimen with an overall estimated expense which was only modestly higher than that of amphotericin B. Together, the present results provide further support for the use of ABLC in the management of VL patients who fail antimony therapy.},

This overview provides an understanding of their clinical pharmacokinetics, which could assist in rationalising and optimising treatment regimens, especially in combining multiple antileishmanial drugs in an attempt to increase efficacy and shorten treatment duration. Pentavalent antimony pharmacokinetics are characterised by rapid renal excretion of unchanged drug and a long terminal half-life, potentially due to intracellular conversion to trivalent antimony. Pentamidine is the only antileishmanial drug metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Paromomycin is excreted by the kidneys unchanged and is eliminated fastest of all antileishmanial drugs. Miltefosine pharmacokinetics are characterized by a long terminal half-life and extensive accumulation during treatment. AMB pharmacokinetics differ per drug formulation, with a fast renal and faecal excretion of AMB deoxylate but a much slower clearance of liposomal AMB resulting in an approximately ten-fold higher exposure. AMB and pentamidine pharmacokinetics have never been evaluated in leishmaniasis patients. Studies linking exposure to effect would be required to define target exposure levels in dose optimisation but have only been performed for miltefosine. Limited research has been conducted on exposure at the drug's site of action, such as skin exposure in cutaneous leishmaniasis patients after systemic administration. Pharmacokinetic data on special patient populations such as HIV co-infected patients are mostly lacking. More research in these areas will help improve clinical outcomes by informed dosing and combination of drugs.},

However, most such cases are asymptomatic, and little information about the prevalence of these infections in HIV-infected individuals is available. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of subclinical infection and the relationship between several Leishmania infection markers by noninvasive methods in asymptomatic HIV-infected patients from Southern Spain. Ninety-two HIV-infected patients, who were consecutively attended at the participant hospitals in 2004, were invited to participate in this study. These patients were asymptomatic and without any history of cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmania kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) was amplified from peripheral blood samples from 28 (30.4\%) of these HIV-infected subjects. Sera from three (3.5\%) patients tested positive for Leishmania by an enzyme-linked immunoassay. Two patients (2.4\%) showed a specific 16-kDa band by Western blotting. In contrast, none of the patients showed a positive agglutination of urine. The leishmanin skin test was positive for four (4.3\%) patients. None of the patients with a PCR-positive result showed a positive reaction by enzyme-linked immunoassay or by specific bands in Western blotting or had a positive leishmanin skin test. In conclusion, L. infantum kDNA was detected in a large proportion of asymptomatic HIV-infected patients, although a demonstrable cellular or humoral immune response to this parasite was not shown. Conversely, Leishmania antigen in urine was not detected in these patients.},

	abstract = {Growth and development are two major aspects of children not readily apparent in adults. Clearance in the paediatric population should be investigated using models that describe size, maturation and organ function influences. Size is the primary covariate and although lean body weight is argued as a better measure than total body weight, the use of different fractions of fat mass to explain how pharmacokinetic parameters vary with body composition has been proposed. Allometric scaling using an empiric power exponent of 3/4 is superior to scaling using body surface area. The sigmoid hyperbolic model has proven useful to describe maturation. An extra parameter that describes asymmetry can be incorporated into this model. These descriptors are used to illustrate creatinine, morphine and paracetamol clearance in children. Simultaneous investigation of pooled GFR, paracetamol and morphine data enabled testing for shared common features of maturation processes. Results suggest that GFR matures before paracetamol or morphine clearance, consistent with phase II conjugation processes that convert xenobiotics to water soluble forms that can subsequently be eliminated from the body through the renal system. The use of such mechanistic approaches improves understanding of paediatric pharmacokinetics; improving dosing predictions and allowing projection in exploratory drug development.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Model evaluation is an important issue in population analyses. We aimed to perform a systematic review of all population PK and/or PD analyses published between 2002 and 2004 to survey the current methods used to evaluate a model and to assess whether those models were adequately evaluated.

Methods
We selected 324 papers in MEDLINE using defined keywords and built a data abstraction form (DAF) composed of a checklist of items to extract the relevant information from these articles with respect to model evaluation. In the DAF, evaluation methods were divided into 3 subsections: basic internal methods (goodness-of-fit plots [GOF], uncertainty in parameter estimates and model sensitivity), advanced internal methods (data splitting, resampling techniques and Monte Carlo simulations) and external model evaluation.

Results
Basic internal evaluation was the most frequently described method in the reports: 65\% of the models involved GOF evaluation. Standard errors or confidence intervals were reported for 50\% of fixed effects but only 22\% of random effects. Advanced internal methods were used in approximately 25\% of models: data splitting was more often used than bootstrap and cross-validation; simulations were used in 6\% of models to evaluate models by visual predictive check or by posterior predictive check. External evaluation was performed in only 7\% of models.

Conclusions
Using the subjective synthesis of model evaluation for each paper, we judged models to be adequately evaluated in 28\% of PK models and 26\% of PD models. Basic internal evaluation was preferred to more advanced methods, probably because the former are performed easily with most software. We also noticed that when the aim of modelling was predictive, advanced internal methods or more stringent methods were more often used.},

The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for valnemulin against MG S6 in artificial medium and chicken serum were determined. In vitro time-killing curves were established according to a series of multiples of the MIC value in an artificial medium, and ex vivo time-killing curves were established in serum samples obtained from infected chickens at different time points after oral administration with an initial titer of 1 × 10(6) color change units (CCU)/mL MG S6. The sigmoid Emax model was used to provide 24 h area under concentration-time curve/minimum inhibitory concentration ratios (AUC0-24h/MIC) for mycoplasmastasis, mycoplasmacidal activity and mycoplasmal elimination, respectively. The inoculum size and micro or macro methods exhibited little effect on MIC determination of MG, whereas matrix had a large effect. The rapid killing activity observed in in vitro time-killing curves seems to indicate that valnemulin was mycoplasmacidal and concentration dependent against MG. The AUC0-24h/MIC ratio for mycoplasmacidal activity and mycoplasmal elimination was 1321 h and 1960 h, respectively. A dosage regimen of 12.4 mg/kg/day and 18.3 mg/kg/day valnemulin was calculated for mycoplasmacidal activity and mycoplasmal elimination against MG S6, respectively.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti-leishmanial drug regimens that include a single dose AmBisome could be suitable for eastern African patients with symptomatic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) but the appropriate single dose is unknown.
METHODOLOGY: A multi-centre, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial with an adaptive design, was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of a single dose and multiple doses of AmBisome for the treatment of VL in eastern Africa. The primary efficacy endpoint was definitive cure (DC) at 6 months. Symptomatic patients with parasitologically-confirmed, non-severe VL, received a single dose of AmBisome 7.5 mg/kg body weight or multiple doses, 7 times 3 mg/kg on days 1-5, 14, and 21. If interim analyses, evaluated 30 days after the start of treatment following 40 or 80 patients, showed the single dose gave significantly poorer parasite clearance than multiple doses at the 5\% significance level, the single dose was increased by 2·5 mg/kg. In a sub-set of patients, parasite clearance was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT) PCR.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The trial was terminated after the third interim analysis because of low efficacy of both regimens. Based on the intention-to-treat population, DC was 85\% (95\%CI 73-93\%), 40\% (95\%CI 19-64\%), and 58\% (95\%CI 41-73\%) in patients treated with multiple doses (n = 63), and single doses of 7·5 (n = 21) or 10 mg/kg (n = 40), respectively. qRT-PCR suggested superior parasite clearance with multiple doses as early as day 3. Safety data accorded with the drug label.
CONCLUSIONS: The tested AmBisome regimens would not be suitable for VL treatment across eastern Africa. An optimal single dose regimen was not identified.

	abstract = {The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in leishmaniasis patients are, to a great extent, unknown. We examined and characterized the pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in a group of patients with Old World (Leishmania major) cutaneous leishmaniasis. Miltefosine plasma concentrations were determined in samples taken during and up to 5 months after the end of treatment from 31 Dutch military personnel who contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and were treated with 150 mg miltefosine/day for 28 days. Samples were analyzed with a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 4 ng/ml. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed with nonlinear mixed-effect modeling, using NONMEM. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine could best be described by an open two-compartment disposition model, with a first elimination half-life of 7.05 days and a terminal elimination half-life of 30.9 days. The median concentration in the last week of treatment (days 22 to 28) was 30,800 ng/ml. The maximum duration of follow-up was 202 days after the start of treatment. All analyzed samples contained a concentration above the LLOQ. Miltefosine is eliminated from the body much slower than previously thought and is therefore still detectable in human plasma samples taken 5 to 6 months after the end of treatment. The presence of subtherapeutic miltefosine concentrations in the blood beyond 5 months after treatment might contribute to the selection of resistant parasites, and moreover, the measures for preventing the teratogenic risks of miltefosine treatment should be reconsidered.},

To develop a new PCR for Leishmania detection and to estimate its diagnostic accuracy in a visceral leishmaniasis (VL) endemic area.


METHODS

After providing the proof-of-concept, the diagnostic accuracy was estimated on blood from 247 non-endemic control persons and on blood and bone marrow from 173 confirmed VL, 39 probable VL and 87 non-VL patients from south-eastern Nepal.


RESULTS

The PCR showed a specificity of 99.64\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 98.93-100\%) on non-endemic controls and a sensitivity of 92.1\% (95\% CI: 87.6-96.6\%) on blood and 92.9\% (95\% CI: 89-96.8\%) on bone marrow from the confirmed VL patients. Leishmania DNA was detected in blood and bone marrow of 67.6\% (95\% CI: 50.8-80.9\%) and 71.8\% (95\% CI: 56.2-83.5\%) of the probable VL patients, respectively, and of 38.2\% (95\% CI: 28-49.4\%) and 29.9\% (95\% CI: 21.3-40.2\%) of the non-VL patients, respectively. The PCR showed 97\% concordance with a positive DAT status while for a negative DAT status this was only 41.3\% (kappa-index 0.416, 95\% CI: 0.30-0.53).


CONCLUSIONS

Our findings indicate that PCR alone rather provides a marker for infection than a marker for disease and its role in VL diagnosis in endemic regions is discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent reports indicated high miltefosine treatment failure rates for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) on the Indian subcontinent. To further explore the pharmacological factors associated with these treatment failures, a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study was performed to examine the relationship between miltefosine drug exposure and treatment failure in a cohort of Nepalese patients with VL.
METHODS: Miltefosine steady-state blood concentrations at the end of treatment were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling and a logistic regression model. Individual estimates of miltefosine exposure were explored for their relationship with treatment failure.
RESULTS: The overall probability of treatment failure was 21\%. The time that the blood concentration was {\textgreater}10 times the half maximal effective concentration of miltefosine (median, 30.2 days) was significantly associated with treatment failure: each 1-day decrease in miltefosine exposure was associated with a 1.08-fold (95\% confidence interval, 1.01-1.17) increased odds of treatment failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Achieving a sufficient exposure to miltefosine is a significant and critical factor for VL treatment success, suggesting an urgent need to evaluate the recently proposed optimal allometric miltefosine dosing regimen. This study establishes the first evidence for a drug exposure-effect relationship for miltefosine in the treatment of VL.},

Clinical manifestations are highly variable and cannot be predicted accurately on the basis of the properties of mutant GC. Analysis of secondary abnormalities, such as elevated plasma levels of some hydrolases, may help to increase insight into the complicated pathophysiology of the disease and could also provide useful disease markers. The recent availability of enzyme supplementation therapy for GD increases the need for markers as early predictors of the efficacy of treatment. We report the finding of a very marked increase in chitotrisidase activity in plasma of 30 of 32 symptomatic type 1 GD patients studied: the median activity being {\textgreater} 600 times the median value in plasma of healthy volunteers. In three GC-deficient individuals without clinical symptoms, only slight increases were noted. Chitotriosidase activity was absent in plasma of three control subjects and two patients. During enzyme supplementation therapy, chitotriosidase activity declined dramatically. We conclude that plasma chitotriosidase levels can serve as a new diagnostic hallmark of GD and should prove to be useful in assessing whether clinical manifestations of GD are present and for monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic intervention.},

Since hematocrit (Ht) values are typically severely decreased in VL patients, regressing to normal during treatment, the method was evaluated over a range of clinically relevant Ht values.Miltefosine was extracted from DBS using a simple pre-treatment method with methanol, resulting in {\textgreater}97\% recovery. The method was validated over a calibration range of 10-2,000 ng/mL and accuracy and precision were within ±11.2\% and ≤7.0\% (≤19.1\% at LLOQ), respectively. The method was accurate and precise for blood spot volumes between 10-30 μL and for an Ht of 20-35\%, though a linear effect of Ht on miltefosine quantification was observed in the bioanalytical validation. DBS samples were stable for at least 162 days at 37°C.Clinical validation of the method using paired DBS and plasma samples from 16 VL patients showed a median observed DBS:plasma miltefosine concentration ratio of 0.99, with good correlation (Pearson's r=0.946). Correcting for patient-specific Ht did not further improve the concordance between the sampling methods.This successfully validated method to quantify miltefosine in DBS was demonstrated to be a valid and practical alternative to venous blood sampling which can be applied in future miltefosine pharmacokinetic studies in leishmaniasis patients, without Ht-correction.},

	abstract = {The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in leishmaniasis patients are, to a great extent, unknown. We examined and characterized the pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in a group of patients with Old World (Leishmania major) cutaneous leishmaniasis. Miltefosine plasma concentrations were determined in samples taken during and up to 5 months after the end of treatment from 31 Dutch military personnel who contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and were treated with 150 mg miltefosine/day for 28 days. Samples were analyzed with a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 4 ng/ml. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed with nonlinear mixed-effect modeling, using NONMEM. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine could best be described by an open two-compartment disposition model, with a first elimination half-life of 7.05 days and a terminal elimination half-life of 30.9 days. The median concentration in the last week of treatment (days 22 to 28) was 30,800 ng/ml. The maximum duration of follow-up was 202 days after the start of treatment. All analyzed samples contained a concentration above the LLOQ. Miltefosine is eliminated from the body much slower than previously thought and is therefore still detectable in human plasma samples taken 5 to 6 months after the end of treatment. The presence of subtherapeutic miltefosine concentrations in the blood beyond 5 months after treatment might contribute to the selection of resistant parasites, and moreover, the measures for preventing the teratogenic risks of miltefosine treatment should be reconsidered.},

The analysis of the methodological quality identified some potential bias that can make it difficult to determine whether truly effective therapies exist for this disease. We found important weaknesses in the adequacy and transparency of randomization, loss of participants, causative Leishmania species, outcome measures, and follow-up times. Given these distorting effects on the evidence base, we propose guidelines for authors who wish to conduct clinical trials aimed at the development of effective therapies in cutaneous leishmaniasis. The recommendations in this report will hopefully deserve the attention of the World Health Organization and assist in the planning and prioritization of global strategies for improving the interpretation and replication of clinical research on cutaneous leishmaniasis.},

Twenty breast cancer patients with progression of skin metastases were treated with a 6\% solution of miltefosine, which was topically administered once daily during the first week and twice daily thereafter. Sixteen out of 20 patients also had metastatic disease at other sites. Concomitant systemic treatment when ongoing for at least 2 months prior to study entry was permitted, and consisted of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy in seven and nine patients, respectively. Prior palliative cytotoxic and hormonal therapy had been administered to 11 and 19 patients, respectively. No grade 3 and 4 toxicity occurred. Miltefosine therapy was discontinued in two patients due to nausea and in one patient due to skin toxicity. Grade 1 and 2 adverse skin reactions, and nausea and vomiting were seen in 11 and two patients, respectively. In 18 patients evaluable for response, four partial responses were noted (response rate 22\%), while seven patients had stable disease. Three partial responses were observed in patients in whom the skin lesions were smaller than 1.5 cm2. Median duration of response was 2.5 months and median time to progression for all patients was 1.9 months. In this study topically applied miltefosine for metastatic skin lesions of breast cancer showed modest activity in a relatively heavily pretreated patient population, without serious systemic toxicity.},

A higher sensitivity of KATEX (73.9\% vs. 41.7\%) and higher specificity of FD-DAT (100.0\% vs. 48.6\%) were demonstrated under passive case detection compared with active case detection. FD-DAT is recommended for confirmation of VL diagnosis in hospital settings, whereas its use in the field will be limited to exclude VL in clinical suspects.

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to determine (i) whether an association exists between individual pharmacokinetic parameters and treatment outcome when feeder cattle were diagnosed with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and treated with gamithromycin (Zactran(®) ) at the label dose and (ii) whether there was a stronger association between treatment outcome and gamithromycin concentration in plasma or in the pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF) effect compartment. The study design was a prospective, blinded, randomized clinical trial utilizing three groups of 60 (362-592 lb) steers/bulls randomly allocated within origin to sham injection or gamithromycin mass medication. Cattle were evaluated daily for signs of BRD by a veterinarian blinded to treatment. Animals meeting the BRD case definition were enrolled and allocated to a sample collection scheme consisting of samples for bacterial isolation (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and nasopharyngeal swabs) and gamithromycin concentration determination (PELF and plasma). Gamithromycin susceptibility of M. haemolytica (n = 287) and P. multocida (n = 257) were determined using broth microdilution with frozen panels containing gamithromycin at concentrations from 0.03 to 16 μg/mL. A two-compartment plasma pharmacokinetic model with an additional compartment for gamithromycin in PELF was developed using rich data sets from published and unpublished studies. The sparse data from our study were then fit to this model using nonlinear mixed effects modeling to estimate individual parameter values. The resulting parameter estimates were used to simulate full time-concentration profiles for each animal in this study. These profiles were analyzed using noncompartmental methods so that PK/PD indices (AUC24 /MIC, AUC∞ /MIC, CMAX /MIC) could be calculated for plasma and PELF (also T{\textgreater}MIC) for each individual. The calculated PK/PD indices were indicative that for both M. haemolytica and P. multocida a higher drug exposure in terms of concentration, and duration of exposure relative to the MIC of the target pathogen, was favorable to a successful case outcome. A significant association was found between treatment success and PELF AUC0-24 /MIC for P. multocida. The calves in this study demonstrated an increased clearance and volume of distribution in plasma as compared to the healthy calves in two previously published reports. Ultimately, the findings from this study indicate that higher PK/PD indices were predictive of positive treatment outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With widespread resistance to antimonials in Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in the Indian subcontinent, Miltefosine (MIL) has been introduced as the first line therapy. Surveillance of MIL susceptibility in natural populations of Leishmania donovani is vital to preserve it and support the VL elimination program.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We measured in vitro susceptibility towards MIL and paromomycin (PMM) in L. donovani isolated from VL and PKDL, pre- and post-treatment cases, using an amastigote-macrophage model. MIL susceptibility of post-treatment isolates from cured VL cases (n = 13, mean IC(50)±SD = 2.43±1.44 µM), was comparable (p{\textgreater}0.05) whereas that from relapses (n = 3, mean IC(50) = 4.72±1.99 µM) was significantly higher (p = 0.04) to that of the pre-treatment group (n = 6, mean IC(50) = 1.86±0.75 µM). In PKDL, post-treatment isolates (n = 3, mean IC(50) = 16.13±2.64 µM) exhibited significantly lower susceptibility (p = 0.03) than pre-treatment isolates (n = 5, mean IC(50) = 8.63±0.94 µM). Overall, PKDL isolates (n = 8, mean IC(50) = 11.45±4.19 µM) exhibited significantly higher tolerance (p{\textless}0.0001) to MIL than VL isolates (n = 22, mean IC(50) = 2.58±1.58 µM). Point mutations in the miltefosine transporter (LdMT) and its beta subunit (LdRos3) genes previously reported in parasites with experimentally induced MIL resistance were not present in the clinical isolates. Further, the mRNA expression profile of these genes was comparable in the pre- and post-treatment isolates. Parasite isolates from VL and PKDL cases were uniformly susceptible to PMM with respective mean IC(50) = 7.05±2.24 µM and 6.18±1.51 µM.
CONCLUSION: The in vitro susceptibility of VL isolates remained unchanged at the end of MIL treatment; however, isolates from relapsed VL and PKDL cases had lower susceptibility than the pre-treatment isolates. PKDL isolates were more tolerant towards MIL in comparison with VL isolates. All parasite isolates were uniformly susceptible to PMM. Mutations in the LdMT and LdRos3 genes as well as changes in the expression of these genes previously correlated with experimental resistance to MIL could not be verified for the field isolates.},

	abstract = {Gemcitabine triphosphate (dFdCTP) is a highly active metabolite of gemcitabine. It is formed intra-cellularly via the phosphorylation of gemcitabine by deoxycytidine kinase. The monitoring of dFdCTP in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), in addition to plasma concentrations of gemcitabine and its metabolite 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine, is considered very useful in determining pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships.We describe a novel sensitive assay for the quantification of dFdCTP in human PBMCs. The method is based on weak anion-exchange liquid chromatography and detection with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The assay has been validated from 1 ng/ml (lower limit of quantification, LLOQ) to 25 ng/ml (upper limit of quantification, ULOQ) using 180 microl aliquots of PBMC extracts containing approximately 0.648 mg protein or 3.8 x 10(6) lysed PBMCs. The LLOQ is equivalent to 94 fmol/10(6) cells (1 ng/ml = 0.18 ng/180 microl or 0.18 ng/0.648 mg protein = 0.047 ng/10(6) cells or 94 fmol/10(6) cells). This highly sensitive assay is capable of quantifying about 200-fold lower concentrations of dFdCTP in human PBMCs than currently available methods.},

As before, epidemics of this sandfly-borne disease occur periodically in India and elsewhere; but leishmaniasis has also emerged in new regions and settings, for example, as an AIDS-associated opportunistic infection. Diagnosis still typically relies on classic microbiological methods, but molecular-based approaches are being tested. Pentavalent antimony compounds have been the mainstay of antileishmanial therapy for half a century, but lipid formulations of amphotericin B (though expensive and administered parenterally) represent a major advance for treating visceral leishmaniasis. A pressing need is for the technological advances in the understanding of the immune response to leishmania and the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis to be translated into field-applicable and affordable methods for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High frequency of relapse in miltefosine-treated visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients in India and Nepal followed up for twelve months.
OBJECTIVE: To identify epidemiological and clinical risk factors for relapse of VL in patients recently treated with standard dosing of miltefosine in India and Nepal.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study in three Primary Health Centers and one reference center in Muzaffarpur district, Bihar, India; and two zonal hospitals and a university hospital in South-east Nepal; records of all consenting patients diagnosed with VL and treated with miltefosine according to the current treatment guidelines of the Kala azar elimination program between 2009 and 2011.
RESULTS: We compared the clinical records of 78 cases of relapse with those of 775 patients who had no record of subsequent relapse. Relapse was 2 times more common amongst male patients (IRR 2.14, 95\% CI 1.27-3.61), and 2 to 3 times more frequent in the age groups below 15 compared to the over 25 year olds (age 10 to 14: IRR 2.53; 95\% CI 1.37-4.65 and Age 2 to 9: IRR 3.19; 95\% CI 1.77-5.77). History of earlier VL episodes, or specific clinical features at time of diagnosis such as duration of symptoms or spleen size were no predictors of relapse.
CONCLUSIONS: Young age and male gender were associated with increased risk of VL relapse after miltefosine, suggesting that the mechanism of relapse is mainly host-related i.e. immunological factors and/or drug exposure (pharmacokinetics). The observed decrease in efficacy of miltefosine may be explained by the inclusion of younger patients compared to the earlier clinical trials, rather than by a decreased susceptibility of the parasite to miltefosine. Our findings highlight the importance of proper clinical trials in children, including pharmacokinetics, to determine the safety, efficacy, drug exposure and therapeutic response of new drugs in this age group.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a major health problem in developing countries. The untreated disease is fatal, available treatment is expensive and often toxic, and drug resistance is increasing. Improved treatment options are needed. Paromomycin was shown to be an efficacious first-line treatment with low toxicity in India.
METHODS: This was a 3-arm multicentre, open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial to compare three treatment regimens for VL in East Africa: paromomycin sulphate (PM) at 15 mg/kg/day for 21 days versus sodium stibogluconate (SSG) at 20 mg/kg/day for 30 days; and the combination of both dose regimens for 17 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was cure based on parasite-free tissue aspirates taken 6 months after treatment.
FINDINGS: Overall, 135 patients per arm were enrolled at five centres in Sudan (2 sites), Kenya (1) and Ethiopia (2), when the PM arm had to be discontinued due to poor efficacy. The trial has continued with the higher dose of PM as well as the combination of PM and SSG arms. These results will be reported later. Baseline patient characteristics were similar among treatment arms. The overall cure with PM was significantly inferior to that with SSG (63.8\% versus 92.2\%; difference 28.5\%, 95\%CI 18.8\% to 38.8\%, p{\textless}0.001). The efficacy of PM varied among centres and was significantly lower in Sudan (14.3\% and 46.7\%) than in Kenya (80.0\%) and Ethiopia (75.0\% and 96.6\%). No major safety issues with PM were identified.
CONCLUSION: The efficacy of PM at 15 mg/kg/day for 21 days was inadequate, particularly in Sudan. The efficacy of higher doses and the combination treatment warrant further studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

There is no effective oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), a disseminated intracellular protozoal infection that occurs worldwide. Miltefosine, an alkyl phospholipid developed as an oral antineoplastic agent, is active against visceral infection in animal models. We tested safety, tolerance, and efficacy of miltefosine in kala-azar.


METHODS

Oral doses of miltefosine were given to six groups of five Indian men for 28 days: 50 mg every second day (group 1), 100 mg every second day (group 2), 100 mg/day (group 3), 150 mg/day (group 4), 200 mg/day (group 5), and 250 mg/day (group 6). Assessment for apparent cure--taken as an afebrile state with decreased spleen size and a splenic-aspirate parasite-density score of 0--was done on days 14 and 28. Definitive cure at 8 months required a parasite-free bone-marrow aspirate and no clinical evidence of relapse.


FINDINGS

21 of 30 patients were apparently cured on day 14. Transient episodes of vomiting and diarrhoea, were common during weeks 1-2 and were seen in 22 patients. Four other patients in groups 5 and 6 had miltefosine withdrawn after 7-10 days because of vomiting. One patient in group 6 developed renal insufficiency and severe diarrhoea and died on day 21. On day 28, all 29 remaining patients were apparently cured. By 8 months, seven of ten patients in groups 1 and 2 had relapsed; however, 18 of 19 patients treated daily (groups 3-6) appeared to be cured. Among the 21 definitive cures were the four patients treated for 10 days or less and 12 for whom previous therapy with pentavalent antimony had failed.


INTERPRETATION

Treatment with miltefosine at 100-150 mg/day for 4 weeks has promise as an effective oral treatment of visceral leishmaniasis including antimony-resistant infection.},

Additional information was collated during meetings conducted at WHO regional level between 2007 and 2011. Two questionnaires regarding epidemiology and drug access were completed by experts and national program managers. Visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis incidence ranges were estimated by country and epidemiological region based on reported incidence, underreporting rates if available, and the judgment of national and international experts. Based on these estimates, approximately 0.2 to 0.4 cases and 0.7 to 1.2 million VL and CL cases, respectively, occur each year. More than 90\% of global VL cases occur in six countries: India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Brazil. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is more widely distributed, with about one-third of cases occurring in each of three epidemiological regions, the Americas, the Mediterranean basin, and western Asia from the Middle East to Central Asia. The ten countries with the highest estimated case counts, Afghanistan, Algeria, Colombia, Brazil, Iran, Syria, Ethiopia, North Sudan, Costa Rica and Peru, together account for 70 to 75\% of global estimated CL incidence. Mortality data were extremely sparse and generally represent hospital-based deaths only. Using an overall case-fatality rate of 10\%, we reach a tentative estimate of 20,000 to 40,000 leishmaniasis deaths per year. Although the information is very poor in a number of countries, this is the first in-depth exercise to better estimate the real impact of leishmaniasis. These data should help to define control strategies and reinforce leishmaniasis advocacy.},

Although the requirement of a somewhat functional immune system for the antileishmanial action of antimony was reported previously, the cellular and molecular mechanism of action of SAG was not clear. Herein, we show that SAG induces extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK-1) and ERK-2 phosphorylation through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase C, and Ras activation and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation through PI3K and Akt activation. ERK-1 and ERK-2 activation results in an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 3 to 6 h after SAG treatment, while p38 MAPK activation and subsequent tumor necrosis factor alpha release result in the production of nitric oxide (NO) 24 h after SAG treatment. Thus, this study has provided the first evidence that SAG treatment induces activation of some important components of the intracellular signaling pathway, which results in an early wave of ROS-dependent parasite killing and a stronger late wave of NO-dependent parasite killing. This opens up the possibility of this metalloid chelate being used in the treatment of various diseases either alone or in combination with other drugs and vaccines.},

	abstract = {A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PB-PK) model was developed to describe trichloroethylene (TCE) kinetics in the pregnant rat exposed to TCE by inhalation, by bolus gavage, or by oral ingestion in drinking water. The kinetics of trichloroacetic acid (TCA), an oxidative metabolite of TCE, were described by a classical one-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Among the required model parameters for TCE, partition coefficients (PCs) and kinetic constants for oxidation were determined by vial equilibration and gas uptake methods, respectively. The fat: blood PC was 33.9; the blood:air PC was 13.2; and the fetal tissue:fetal blood PC was 0.51. TCE was readily metabolized with high substrate affinity. In naive and pregnant female rats the maximum velocities of oxidative metabolism were 10.98 ± 0.155 and 9.18 ± 0.078 mg/kg/hr, while the estimated Michaelis constant for the two groups of rats was very low, 0.25 mg/liter. The first-order rate constant for oral absorption of TCE from water was 5.4 ± 0.42/hr−1 in naive rats. With TCA, the volume of distribution (0.618 liter/kg) and the plasma elimination rate constant (0.045 ± 0.0024/hour) were estimated both from intravenous dosing studies with TCA and from an inhalation study with TCE. By comparison of the two routes of administration, the stoichiometric yield of TCA from TCE was estimated to be 0.12 in pregnant rats. To develop a data base for testing the fidelity of the PB-PK model, inhalation and bolus gavage exposures were conducted from Day 3 to Day 21 of pregnancy and a drinking water exposure from Day 3 to Day 22 of pregnancy. Inhalation exposures with TCE vapor were 4 hr/day at 618 ppm. The TCE concentration in drinking water was 350 μg/ml and the gavaged rats received single daily doses of 2.3 mg TCE/kg. Time varying physiological parameters for compartment volumes and blood flows during pregnancy were obtained from the published literature. Using the kinetic parameters determined by experimentation, TCE concentrations in maternal and fetal blood and TCA concentrations in maternal and fetal plasma were predicted from the PB-PK model by computer simulation and compared favorably with limited data obtained at restricted time points during pregnancy for all three routes of exposure. On the basis of the PB-PK model, fetal exposure to TCE, as area-under-the-curve, ranged from 67 to 76\% of maternal exposure. For TCA the fetal exposure was 63 to 64\% of the maternal exposure. The fetus is clearly at risk both to parent TCE and its TCA metabolite. With further validation, PB-PK modeling of expected fetal exposure should prove helpful in the design and interpretation of teratology and reproductive toxicology studies with a variety of volatile chemicals.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE

Amphotericin B (AmB) in small, unilamellar liposomes (AmBisome) has an improved therapeutic index, and altered pharmacokinetics. The repeat-dose safety and toxicokinetic profiles of AmBisome were studied at clinically relevant doses.


METHODS

Beagle dogs (5/sex/group) received intravenous AmBisome (0.25, 1, 4, 8, and 16 mg/kg/day), empty liposomes or vehicle for 30 days. AmB was determined in plasma on days 1, 14, and 30, and in tissues on day 31. Safety parameters included body weight, clinical chemistry, hematology and microscopic pathology.


RESULTS

Seventeen of twenty animals receiving 8 and 16 mg/kg were sacrificed early due to weight loss caused by reduced food intake. Dose-dependent renal tubular nephrosis, and other effects characteristic of conventional AmB occurred at 1 mg/kg/day or higher. Although empty liposomes and AmBisome increased plasma cholesterol, no toxicities unique to AmBisome were revealed. Plasma ultrafiltrates contained no AmB. AmBisome achieved plasma levels 100-fold higher than other AmB formulations. AmBisome kinetics were non-linear, with clearance and distribution volumes decreasing with increasing dose. This, and nonlinear tissue uptake, suggest AmBisome disposition was saturable.


CONCLUSIONS

AmBisome has the same toxic effects as conventional AmB, but they appear at much higher plasma exposures. AmBisome's non-linear pharmacokinetics are not associated with increased risk, as toxicity increases linearly with dosage. Dogs tolerated AmBisome with minimal to moderate changes in renal function at doses (4 mg/kg/day) producing peak plasma concentrations of 18-94 microg/mL.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Some 50\% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) worldwide live in the Indian state of Bihar. Liposomal amphotericin B is an effective treatment when administered in short courses. We wanted to determine whether the efficacy of a single infusion of liposomal amphotericin B was inferior to conventional parenteral therapy, consisting of 15 alternate-day infusions of amphotericin B deoxycholate.


METHODS

In this open-label study, we randomly assigned 412 patients in a 3:1 ratio to receive either liposomal amphotericin B (liposomal-therapy group) or amphotericin B deoxycholate (conventional-therapy group). Liposomal amphotericin B (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight) was given once, and patients were discharged home 24 hours later. Amphotericin B deoxycholate, which was administered in 15 infusions of 1 mg per kilogram, was given every other day during a 29-day hospitalization. We determined the cure rate 6 months after treatment.


RESULTS

A total of 410 patients--304 of 304 patients (100\%) in the liposomal-therapy group and 106 of 108 patients (98\%) in the conventional-therapy group--had apparent cure responses at day 30. Cure rates at 6 months were similar in the two groups: 95.7\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 93.4 to 97.9) in the liposomal-therapy group and 96.3\% (95\% CI, 92.6 to 99.9) in the conventional-therapy group. Adverse events in the liposomal-therapy group were infusion-related fever or rigors (in 40\%) and increased anemia or thrombocytopenia (in 2\%); such events in the conventional-therapy group were fever or rigors (in 64\%), increased anemia (in 19\%), and hypokalemia (in 2\%). Nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity developed in no more than 1\% of patients in each group.


CONCLUSIONS

A single infusion of liposomal amphotericin B was not inferior to and was less expensive than conventional therapy with amphotericin B deoxycholate. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00628719.)},

Basically, the in vivo efficacy of antibiotics that exert concentration-dependent effects can be predicted using conventional PK/PD indices such as the ratio of the area under the curve to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) and/or the ratio of the maximum plasma concentration to MIC (Cmax/MIC), whereas that of antibiotics with time-dependent effects can be determined using the period of time for which the drug concentration exceeds the MIC (time above MIC [TAM]). However, an optimal PK/PD index remains to be established for some antibiotics. Thus, a PK/PD model which describes the PK profile and effect of an antibiotic was developed, and the results obtained from this model were interpreted to form a PK/PD index map to assess the optimal PK/PD index for the antibiotic. The findings from the map were generally consistent with clinical outcomes even for the antibiotics which proved to be exceptions to the conventional classification. For example, AUC/MIC was an optimal index for azithromycin despite its time-dependent bactericidal activity, and Cmax/MIC was a poor index for arbekacin despite its concentration-dependent profile. Thus, the map would be useful for selecting the appropriate PK/PD index for an antibiotic.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Chitotriosidase (CT) is a surrogate plasma marker for Gaucher disease. The enzyme is released by storage cells and is on average thousand fold elevated in serum of Gaucher patients. Plasma CT level is measured with the substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl (4MU)-chitotriose or 4MU-chitobiose. Given the limitations associated with the use of these substrates, a novel substrate, 4MU-deoxychitobiose, has recently been conceived.


METHODS

Chitotriosidase activity was measured with all three substrates in serum samples from 91 type 1 Gaucher patients. Glucocerebrosidase and chitotriosidase genotypes were determined as well as disease parameters.


RESULTS

Chitotriosidase activity when measured with 4MU-deoxychitobiose gave higher values and was proportional to enzyme concentration over a much larger range as compared to the other two substrates. Patients that were carrier for the common CT mutation showed on average half the activity of those with wild type CT genotype. Plasma CT levels correlated best with combined liver and spleen volume: r=0.53 (p{\textless}0.001).


CONCLUSIONS

The use of 4MU-deoxychitobiose as substrate renders a substantial improved CT activity assay and may further facilitate accurate laboratory monitoring of Gaucher patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

There is no effective orally administered medication for any leishmania infection. We investigated miltefosine, which can be taken orally, for the treatment of Indian visceral leishmaniasis. Miltefosine is a phosphocholine analogue that affects cell-signaling pathways and membrane synthesis.


METHODS

The study was an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 trial in which four 30-person cohorts received 50, 100, or 150 mg of miltefosine per day for four or six weeks. The 120 patients, who ranged in age from 12 to 50 years, had anorexia, fever, and splenomegaly with at least moderate (2+) leishmania in a splenic aspirate. A parasitologic cure was defined by the absence of parasites in a splenic aspirate obtained two weeks after completion of treatment. The clinical response was assessed at six months.


RESULTS

In all 120 patients there was an initial parasitologic cure. Six patients had clinical and parasitologic relapses; the remaining 114 patients had not relapsed by six months after treatment, for a cure rate of 95 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 89 to 98 percent). With the regimen of 100 mg of miltefosine per day (approximately 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) for four weeks, 29 of 30 patients (97 percent) were cured. Gastrointestinal side effects were frequent (occurring in 62 percent of patients) but mild to moderate in severity, and no patient discontinued therapy because of gastrointestinal side effects. In two patients, treatment was discontinued because of elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase or creatinine; in both patients the levels rapidly returned to normal. In 12 other patients, the level of aspartate aminotransferase increased to 100 to 150 U per liter during treatment.


CONCLUSIONS

Orally administered miltefosine appears to be an effective treatment for Indian visceral leishmaniasis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ceftazidime and meropenem are frequently used in the empirical treatment of hospital-acquired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infections. Although their dispositions in CSF have been described, the ability of these agents to achieve critical pharmacodynamic targets against the array of nosocomial CSF Gram-negative bacteria encountered in practice has not been reported. METHODS: Serum and CSF pharmacokinetic data were obtained from hospital patients with external ventricular drains and who received ceftazidime or meropenem. Concentration-time profiles in serum and CSF were modelled using a three-compartment model with zero-order infusion and first-order elimination and transfer. The model parameters were identified using population pharmacokinetic analysis [Big Non-Parametric Adaptive Grid (BigNPAG)]. A Monte Carlo simulation (9999 subjects) estimated the probability of target attainment (PTA) for total drug CSF concentrations at 50\% and 100\% T({\textgreater}MIC) for ceftazidime 2 g intravenously every 8 h and meropenem 2 g intravenously every 8 h. The Gram-negative infection isolates of the seven most prevalent Gram-negative bacilli from the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection Program were used as a measure of contemporary MIC distribution. RESULTS: Post-Bayesian measures of bias and precision, observed-predicted plots and R(2) values were highly acceptable for both drugs. Although the PTA in CSF was approximately one dilution higher for ceftazidime compared with meropenem at a given MIC value, the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) in CSF against all Gram-negatives was markedly higher for meropenem when compared with ceftazidime secondary to the higher occurrence of lower MIC values for meropenem. Both agents had a low CFR against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacodynamics of meropenem was superior to that of ceftazidime against Gram-negative pathogens in the CSF.},

While failure rates were higher in children with VL, steady-state concentrations appeared lower than those seen with adults. We hypothesized that the current linear dosage (in milligrams per kilogram of body weight) is too low for children and that a new dosing algorithm based on an appropriate body size model would result in an optimal exposure. A population PK analysis was performed on three historic pooled data sets, including Indian children, Indian adults, and European adults. Linear and allometric scaling of PK parameters by either body weight or fat-free mass (FFM) was evaluated for body size models. Based on the developed PK model, a dosing algorithm for miltefosine in children and adults was proposed and evaluated in silico. The population PK model employing allometric scaling fitted best to the pooled miltefosine data. Allometric scaling by FFM reduced between-subject variability, e.g., for drug clearance, from 49.6\% to 32.1\%. A new allometric miltefosine dosing algorithm was proposed. Exposure to miltefosine was lower in children than adults receiving 2.5 mg/kg/day: a C(max) of 18.8 μg/ml was reached by 90\% of adults and 66.7\% of children. The allometric daily dose resulted in similar levels of exposure to miltefosine for adults and children. The use of a new allometric dosing algorithm for miltefosine in VL patients results in optimal exposure to miltefosine in both adults and children and might improve clinical outcome in children.},

The objective of our study was to re-evaluate in vivo antimicrobial activity of marbofloxacin against Pasteurella multocida using subcutaneously implanted tissue cages in calves.

The ratio of 24 h area under the concentration-time curve divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration or the mutant prevention concentration (AUC24 h/MIC or AUC24 h/MPC) was the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index that best described the effectiveness of marbofloxacin against P. multocida (R (2) = 0.8514) by non-linear regression analysis.

	abstract = {Author Summary        Visceral Leishmaniasis is a neglected, life-threatening disease affecting the poorest of the poor. It has received more attention in light of the regional VL elimination program. A deterministic compartmental model was developed to estimate parameters for L. donovani transmission and to optimise intervention success. Our simulation results show that transmission of L. donovani is predominantly driven by asymptomatically infected hosts who are not eligible for treatment. Treatment can reduce the prevalence of symptomatic disease, but the incidence of KA remains on similar levels because of an unchanged intensity of transmission. In contrast to treatment-related interventions, vector-related interventions have the potential to reduce the prevalence of asymptomatic infections and thus are the intervention of choice from an epidemiological perspective. Vector control, however, should be combined with treatment, as PKDL cases can act as reservoirs of infection. This reservoir function originates from the long period of nearly two years on average during which putatively recovered KA patients develop PKDL.},

	abstract = {Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite, resides and replicates as amastigotes within macrophages. The parasite inflicts the disease visceral leishmaniasis by suppressing host cell function. Neither a therapeutic vaccine nor an effective anti-leishmanial drug to reverse the immunosuppression is available. Although miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine or HPC) is a promising orally bioavailable anti-leishmanial drug, its efficacy is seriously compromised by contra-indications in pregnant women. Further rational redesigning of the drug requires studies on its mechanism of action, which is unknown at present. Because miltefosine is proposed to have immunomodulatory functions, we examined whether miltefosine exerts its anti-leishmanial functions by activating macrophages. We observed that miltefosine’s anti-leishmanial function was significantly compromised in IFN-γ-deficient macrophages suggesting the importance of endogenous IFN-γ in miltefosine-induced anti-leishmanial functions of macrophages. Miltefosine induced IFN-γ, neutralization of which reduced the anti-leishmanial functions of macrophages. IFN-γ responsiveness is reduced in L. donovani-infected macrophages but is significantly restored by miltefosine, as it enhances IFN-γ receptors and IFN-γ induced STAT-1 phosphorylation but reduced activation of SHP-1, the phosphatase implicated in the down-regulation of STAT-1 phosphorylation. Miltefosine induced protein kinase C-dependent and PI3K-dependent p38MAP kinase phosphorylation and anti-leishmanial function. Miltefosine promotes p38MAP kinase-dependent anti-leishmanial functions and IL-12-dependent Th1 response. Leishmania donovani-infected macrophages induced Th2 response but miltefosine treatment reversed the response to Th1-type. Thus, our data define for the first time the mechanistic basis of host cell-dependent anti-leishmanial function of miltefosine.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To test short course, low dose liposomal amphotericin B as single or daily infusion treatment in Indian visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar).


DESIGN

Randomised, open label study.


SETTING

Inpatient unit for leishmaniasis in Bihar, India.


PARTICIPANTS

91 adults and children with splenic aspirate positive for infection.


INTERVENTIONS

Total dose of 5 mg/kg of liposomal amphotericin B given as a single infusion (n=46) or as once daily infusions of 1 mg/kg for five days (n=45).


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

Clinical and parasitological cure assessed 14 days after treatment and long term definitive cure (healthy, no relapse) at six months.


RESULTS

All but one person in each group had an initial apparent cure. During six months of follow up, three patients in the single dose group and two in the five dose group relapsed. Complete response (definitive cure) was therefore achieved in 84 of 91 subjects (92\%): 42 of 46 patients in the single dose group (91\%, 95\% confidence interval 79\% to 98\%) and 42 of 45 in the five dose group (93\%, 82\% to 99\%). Response rates in the two groups were not significantly different.


CONCLUSION

Low dose liposomal amphotericin B (5 mg/kg), given either as a five day course or as a single infusion, seems to be effective for visceral leishmaniasis and warrants further testing.},

The polymorphic pattern revealed by partial characterization of the gene encoding G6PD generated molecular markers useful in the identification of different Leishmania species by PCR. Initially degenerate oligonucleotides were designed on the basis of data on the conserved active center described for other organisms. Primers for reverse transcription-PCR experiments, designed from the nucleotide sequence of the PCR product, enabled us to characterize the 5' and 3' untranslated regions and the G6PD open reading frame of reference strains of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis, Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana, and Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis. Sets of paired primers were designed and used in PCR assays to discriminate between the parasites responsible for tegumentar leishmaniasis of the subgenera Leishmania (Leishmania) and Leishmania (Viannia) and to distinguish L. (Viannia) braziliensis from others organisms of the subgenus Leishmania (Viannia). No amplification products were detected for the DNA of Crithidia fasciculata, Trypanosoma cruzi, or Leishmania (Sauroleishmania) tarentolae or DNA from a healthy human control. The tests proved to be specific and were sensitive enough to detect parasites in human biopsy specimens. The successful discrimination of L. (Viannia) braziliensis from other parasites of the subgenus Leishmania (Viannia) opens the way to epidemiological studies in areas where more than one species of the subgenus Leishmania (Viannia) exist, such as Amazonia, as well as follow-up studies after chemotherapy and assessment of clinical prognoses.},

In contrast, 1-O-alkenyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 1-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and 1-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycerol already showed a 50\% inhibition of growth at concentrations between 2.1 and 2.8 microM. Moreover, the unnatural alkyl lysophospholipid analogue 1-O-octadecyl-2-methoxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was even 10-fold more toxic. Incubations of L. donovani promastigotes with radioactively labelled ether lysophospholipids revealed a rapid uptake of these compounds and their incorporation into cellular lipids at a non-toxic concentration of 1.0 microM. An accumulation of the lysophospholipids in the cell due to insufficient metabolism may be the cause of its cytotoxic effect. The sensitivity of L. donovani cells towards ether lysophospholipids was found to be similar to that reported for tumor cells.},

	abstract = {Background: Lean bodyweight (LBW) has been recommended for scaling drug doses. However, the current methods for predicting LBW are inconsistent at extremes of size and could be misleading with respect to interpreting weight-based regimens., Objective: The objective of the present study was to develop a semi-mechanistic model to predict fat-free mass (FFM) from subject characteristics in a population that includes extremes of size. FFM is considered to closely approximate LBW. There are several reference methods for assessing FFM, whereas there are no reference standards for LBW., Patients and methods: A total of 373 patients (168 male, 205 female) were included in the study. These data arose from two populations. Population A (index dataset) contained anthropometric characteristics, FFM estimated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA - a reference method) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) data. Population B (test dataset) contained the same anthropometric measures and FFM data as population A, but excluded BIA data. The patients in population A had a wide range of age (18-82 years), bodyweight (40.7-216.5kg) and BMI values (17.1-69.9 kg/m2). Patients in population B had BMI values of 18.7-38.4 kg/m2. A two-stage semi-mechanistic model to predict FFM was developed from the demographics from population A. For stage 1 a model was developed to predict impedance and for stage 2 a model that incorporated predicted impedance was used to predict FFM. These two models were combined to provide an overall model to predict FFM from patient characteristics. The developed model for FFM was externally evaluated by predicting into population B., Results: The semi-mechanistic model to predict impedance incorporated sex, height and bodyweight. The developed model provides a good predictor of impedance for both males and females (r2 = 0.78, mean error [ME] = 2.30 x 10-3, root mean square error [RMSE] = 51.56 [approximately 10\% of mean]). The final model for FFM incorporated sex, height and bodyweight. The developed model for FFM provided good predictive performance for both males and females (r2 = 0.93, ME = -0.77, RMSE = 3.33 [approximately 6\% of mean]). In addition, the model accurately predicted the FFM of subjects in population B (r2 = 0.85, ME = -0.04, RMSE = 4.39 [approximately 7\% of mean])., Conclusions: A semi-mechanistic model has been developed to predict FFM (and therefore LBW) from easily accessible patient characteristics. This model has been prospectively evaluated and shown to have good predictive performance., Copyright 2005 Adis Data Information BV},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High frequency of relapse in miltefosine-treated visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients in India and Nepal followed up for twelve months.
OBJECTIVE: To identify epidemiological and clinical risk factors for relapse of VL in patients recently treated with standard dosing of miltefosine in India and Nepal.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study in three Primary Health Centers and one reference center in Muzaffarpur district, Bihar, India; and two zonal hospitals and a university hospital in South-east Nepal; records of all consenting patients diagnosed with VL and treated with miltefosine according to the current treatment guidelines of the Kala azar elimination program between 2009 and 2011.
RESULTS: We compared the clinical records of 78 cases of relapse with those of 775 patients who had no record of subsequent relapse. Relapse was 2 times more common amongst male patients (IRR 2.14, 95\% CI 1.27-3.61), and 2 to 3 times more frequent in the age groups below 15 compared to the over 25 year olds (age 10 to 14: IRR 2.53; 95\% CI 1.37-4.65 and Age 2 to 9: IRR 3.19; 95\% CI 1.77-5.77). History of earlier VL episodes, or specific clinical features at time of diagnosis such as duration of symptoms or spleen size were no predictors of relapse.
CONCLUSIONS: Young age and male gender were associated with increased risk of VL relapse after miltefosine, suggesting that the mechanism of relapse is mainly host-related i.e. immunological factors and/or drug exposure (pharmacokinetics). The observed decrease in efficacy of miltefosine may be explained by the inclusion of younger patients compared to the earlier clinical trials, rather than by a decreased susceptibility of the parasite to miltefosine. Our findings highlight the importance of proper clinical trials in children, including pharmacokinetics, to determine the safety, efficacy, drug exposure and therapeutic response of new drugs in this age group.},

Neutropenic mice had 10(6.2-7.1) CFU/thigh when treated with ceftolozane for 24 h with (i) various doses (3.12 to 1,600 mg/kg) and dosage intervals (3, 6, 12, and 24 h) against two Enterobacteriaceae strains, (ii) 0.39 to 800 mg/kg every 6 h for four Enterobacteriaceae and four P. aeruginosa strains, and (iii) 400 or 800 mg/kg with 2:1. 4:1, and 8:1 ratios of tazobactam against five Enterobacteriaceae strains with ESBLs. The pharmacokinetics of ceftolozane at 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg were linear with peak/dose values of 1.0 to 1.4 and half-lives of 12 to 14 min.

At 200 mg/kg every 3 h, the rate of in vivo killing of P. aeruginosa was faster with ceftolozane than with ceftazidime (-0.34 to -0.41 log10 CFU/thigh/h versus -0.21 to -0.24 log10 CFU/thigh/h). The 2:1 ratio of ceftolozane with tazobactam was the most potent combination studied.

PKDL is considered an important reservoir for the parasite and its treatment may help in the control of VL. Currently, treatment is mainly with sodium stibogluconate (SSG), an expensive and fairly toxic drug and without universally in treatment protocols used. A literature review, a consensus of a panel of experts, and unpublished data formed the basis for the development of guidelines for the treatment of PKDL in the Sudan. Six treatment modalities were evaluated. Experts were asked to justify their choices based on their experience regarding of drug safety, efficacy, availability, and cost. The consensus was defined by assigning a categorical rank (first line, second line, third line) to each option. Regarding the use of AmBisome the presence of the drug in the skin was confirmed in smears from PKDL lesions. Recommendations: AmBisome at 2.5 mg/kg/day/20 days or SSG at 20 mg/kg/day/40 days plus four/weekly intradermal injection of alum-precipitated autoclave L. major vaccine are suggested as first- and second-treatment options for PKDL in the Sudan, respectively. SSG at 20 mg/Kg/day/60 or more days can be used if other options are not available.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Unlike CD4+ T cells, HIV-1 infected macrophages exhibit extended life span even upon stress, consistent with their in vivo role as long-lived HIV-1 reservoirs. Results: Here, we demonstrate that PI3K/Akt inhibitors, including clinically available Miltefosine, dramatically reduced HIV-1 production from long-living virus-infected macrophages. These PI3K/Akt inhibitors hyper-sensitize infected macrophages to extracellular stresses that they are normally exposed to, and eventually leads to cell death of infected macrophages without harming uninfected cells. Based on the data from these Akt inhibitors, we were able to further investigate how HIV-1 infection utilizes the PI3K/Akt pathway to establish the cytoprotective effect of HIV-1 infection, which extends the lifespan of infected macrophages, a key viral reservoir. First, we found that HIV-1 infection activates the well characterized pro-survival PI3K/Akt pathway in primary human macrophages, as reflected by decreased PTEN protein expression and increased Akt kinase activity. Interestingly, the expression of HIV-1 or SIV Tat is sufficient to mediate this cytoprotective effect, which is dependent on the basic domain of Tat - a region that has previously been shown to bind p53. Next, we observed that this interaction appears to contribute to the downregulation of PTEN expression, since HIV-1 Tat was found to compete with PTEN for p53 binding; this is known to result in p53 destabilization, with a consequent reduction in PTEN protein production. Conclusions: Since HIV-1 infected macrophages display highly elevated Akt activity, our results collectively show that PI3K/Akt inhibitors may be a novel therapy for interfering with the establishment of long-living HIV-1 infected reservoirs.},

Oral treatment with hexadecylphosphocholine (HePC) efficiently reduces parasite burden in murine visceral leishmaniasis. Drugs for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis are most commonly administered parenterally, whereas efficient drugs for topical treatment are not in current use. Here we investigate the efficacy of topical treatment with HePC in mice infected with Leishmania mexicana or L. major, causative agents of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the New and Old World, respectively. BALB/c, CBA/J and C57BL/6 inbred mice do not control infection with L. mexicana because they do not mount an efficient Th1-type anti-parasitic lymphocyte response. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice are resistant to an infection with L. major, developing only transient lesions that heal spontaneously owing to an efficient Th1 response. BALB/c, CBA/J and C57BL/6 mice were infected subcutaneously with L. mexicana amastigotes, causing nodular lesions after 5 months. Topical treatment with HePC (Miltex) was highly effective in reducing parasite burden and healed established lesions. The treatment did not induce a Th1 response in L. mexicana-infected susceptible mice and most of the mice relapsed. In resistant C57BL/6 mice infected subcutaneously with 2 x 10(6) L. major promastigotes at the tail base, nodular lesions developed after 2 weeks. Topical treatment with Miltex reduced the parasite load and the mice healed their lesions much faster than the untreated infected controls. The clinical application of Miltex for treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis may be highly efficient because humans, similarly to resistant mice, in general do not relapse after healing. Clinical trials should be straightforward considering that Miltex is an approved drug for the treatment of breast cancer metastases.},

The aim of the study was an analysis of the pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and the PK/PD: CMAX/MIC index in patients with cystic fibrosis. Six patients with cystic fibrosis, with the identified microbiological factor were subjected to the examination. The patients received ciprofloxacin in the dose of 400 mg/12 h (i.v.). Plasma drug concentration was measured by HPLC-UV method after the first dose (Cmax1) and at steady state (Cssmax, Cssmin). The following mean values of ciprofloxacin blood concentrations were obtained from the analyzed patients: Cmax1 = 2.34 (+/- 1.15) microg/mL, Cssmax = 2.49 (+/- 1.44) pg/mL, Cssmin = 0.42 (+/- 0.22) pg/mL. The mean values of the Cmax1/MIC and Cssmax/MIC indexes were 3.66 +/- 2.34) and 3.38 (+/-1.73), respectively. Low values of the Cmax/MIC index for ciprofloxacin in the analyzed patients may indicate too low concentrations of the drug in the blood in relation to the MIC value of pathogens and the need to verify the assumed administration scheme.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Lean bodyweight (LBW) has been recommended for scaling drug doses. However, the current methods for predicting LBW are inconsistent at extremes of size and could be misleading with respect to interpreting weight-based regimens.


OBJECTIVE

The objective of the present study was to develop a semi-mechanistic model to predict fat-free mass (FFM) from subject characteristics in a population that includes extremes of size. FFM is considered to closely approximate LBW. There are several reference methods for assessing FFM, whereas there are no reference standards for LBW.


PATIENTS AND METHODS

A total of 373 patients (168 male, 205 female) were included in the study. These data arose from two populations. Population A (index dataset) contained anthropometric characteristics, FFM estimated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA - a reference method) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) data. Population B (test dataset) contained the same anthropometric measures and FFM data as population A, but excluded BIA data. The patients in population A had a wide range of age (18-82 years), bodyweight (40.7-216.5 kg) and BMI values (17.1-69.9 kg/m2). Patients in population B had BMI values of 18.7-38.4 kg/m2. A two-stage semi-mechanistic model to predict FFM was developed from the demographics from population A. For stage 1 a model was developed to predict impedance and for stage 2 a model that incorporated predicted impedance was used to predict FFM. These two models were combined to provide an overall model to predict FFM from patient characteristics. The developed model for FFM was externally evaluated by predicting into population B.


RESULTS

The semi-mechanistic model to predict impedance incorporated sex, height and bodyweight. The developed model provides a good predictor of impedance for both males and females (r2 = 0.78, mean error [ME] = 2.30 x 10(-3), root mean square error [RMSE] = 51.56 [approximately 10\% of mean]). The final model for FFM incorporated sex, height and bodyweight. The developed model for FFM provided good predictive performance for both males and females (r2 = 0.93, ME = -0.77, RMSE = 3.33 [approximately 6\% of mean]). In addition, the model accurately predicted the FFM of subjects in population B (r2 = 0.85, ME = -0.04, RMSE = 4.39 [approximately 7\% of mean]).


CONCLUSIONS

A semi-mechanistic model has been developed to predict FFM (and therefore LBW) from easily accessible patient characteristics. This model has been prospectively evaluated and shown to have good predictive performance.},

	abstract = {The synthetic alkyl-lysophospholipid (ALP), 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine, is an antitumor agent that acts on cell membranes and can induce apoptosis. We investigated how ALP is taken up by cells, how it affects de novo biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), and how critical this is to initiate apoptosis. We compared an ALP-sensitive mouse lymphoma cell line, S49, with an ALP-resistant variant, S49(AR). ALP inhibited PC synthesis at the CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) step in S49 cells, but not in S49(AR) cells. Exogenous lysophosphatidylcholine, providing cells with an alternative way (acylation) to generate PC, rescued cells from ALP-induced apoptosis, indicating that continuous rapid PC turnover is essential for cell survival. Apoptosis induced by other stimuli that do not target PC synthesis remained unaffected by lysophosphatidylcholine. Using monensin, low temperature and albumin back-extraction, we demonstrated that ALP is internalized by endocytosis, a process defective in S49(AR) cells. This defect neither involved clathrin-coated pit- nor fluid-phase endocytosis, but depended on lipid rafts, because disruption of these microdomains with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin or filipin (sequestering cholesterol) or bacterial sphingomyelinase reduced uptake of ALP. Furthermore, ALP was found accumulated in isolated rafts and disruption of rafts also prevented the inhibition of PC synthesis and apoptosis induction in S49 cells. In summary, ALP is internalized by raft-dependent endocytosis to inhibit PC synthesis, which triggers apoptosis.},

We show that whole-genome sequence data reveals genetic structure within these lines not shown by multilocus typing, and suggests that drug resistance has emerged multiple times in this closely related set of lines. Sequence comparisons with other Leishmania species and analysis of single-nucleotide diversity within our sample showed evidence of selection acting in a range of surface- and transport-related genes, including genes associated with drug resistance. Against a background of relative genetic homogeneity, we found extensive variation in chromosome copy number between our lines. Other forms of structural variation were significantly associated with drug resistance, notably including gene dosage and the copy number of an experimentally verified circular episome present in all lines and described here for the first time. This study provides a basis for more powerful molecular profiling of visceral leishmaniasis, providing additional power to track the drug resistance and epidemiology of an important human pathogen.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE

This study aimed to characterize the transepithelial transport of miltefosine (HePC), the first orally effective drug against visceral leishmaniasis, across the intestinal barrier to further understand its oral absorption mechanism.


MATERIALS AND METHODS

Caco-2 cell monolayers were used as an in vitro model of the human intestinal barrier. The roles of active and passive mechanisms in HePC intestinal transport were investigated and the relative contributions of the transcellular and paracellular routes were estimated.


RESULTS

HePC transport was observed to be pH-independent, partially temperature-dependent, linear as a function of time and non-saturable as a function of concentration. The magnitude of HePC transport was quite similar to that of the paracellular marker mannitol, and EDTA treatment led to an increase in HePC transport. Furthermore, HePC transport was found to be similar in the apical-to-basolateral and basolateral-to-apical directions, strongly suggesting that HePC exhibits non-polarized transport and that no MDR-mediated efflux was involved.


CONCLUSIONS

These results demonstrate that HePC crosses the intestinal epithelium by a non-specific passive pathway and provide evidence supporting a concentration-dependent paracellular transport mechanism, although some transcellular diffusion cannot be ruled out. Considering that HePC opens epithelial tight junctions, this study shows that HePC may promote its own permeation across the intestinal barrier.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: HIV protease inhibitors (HPIs) are an important component of highly active antiretroviral therapy. However, the activity of drug efflux transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP1/MRP2), may limit intracellular drug accumulation. Drugs that inhibit the activity of drug efflux proteins may, in combination with HPIs, enhance the clinical efficacy of the drugs. METHODS: The transport of [(14)C]lopinavir was evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the absence or presence of known inhibitors: tariquidar (P-gp), MK571 (MRP), frusemide (MRP1/2), dipyridamole (MRP1/P-gp) and probenecid (MRP2/OATP). The effects of ritonavir, amprenavir and atazanavir on the accumulation of lopinavir were also evaluated in cultured CD4(+) T-lymphoblastoid cells [CEM (parental), CEM(VBL) (P-gp-overexpressing) and CEM(E1000) (MRP1-overexpressing)] and PBMCs. The relative expression of the drug efflux proteins on the PBMCs was assessed by flow cytometric and real-time PCR methods. RESULTS: Tariquidar, MK571, frusemide and dipyridamole all significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of lopinavir in the PBMCs, whereas probenecid decreased it. The cellular accumulation ratio (CAR) of lopinavir was also increased by ritonavir, amprenavir and atazanavir in a concentration-dependent manner in both cell types. The expression of P-gp, MRP1 and MRP2 mRNA were variable and individually did not correlate with CARs of lopinavir. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that lopinavir is a substrate of P-gp, MRP1 and MRP2. The intracellular concentration of lopinavir is increased when co-incubated with ritonavir, amprenavir and atazanavir in PBMCs. Manipulation of drug efflux transporters may be a useful strategy for increasing the intracellular concentration and thereby enhancing the clinical efficacy of lopinavir.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Although mucosal leishmaniasis is a prominent disease, it has been studied only to a limited extent. It is classically treated with parenteral antimony or, as a last resort, amphotericin B.


METHODS

We treated Bolivian mucosal leishmaniasis due to Leishmania braziliensis with the oral agent miltefosine, 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days, and followed-up for 12 months.


RESULTS

Seventy-two patients were evaluable. The cure rate for the 36 patients who had "mild" disease (i.e., affecting nasal skin and nasal mucosa) was 83\%. The cure rate for the 36 patients who had more extensive disease (involving the palate, pharynx, and larynx) was 58\%. Patients refused to be randomized to parenteral agents, but the cure rate for an almost contemporary group who was receiving amphotericin B (45 mg/kg over 90 days) was 7 (50\%) of 14.


CONCLUSIONS

In this unrandomized trial, oral miltefosine was at least as effective as heroic doses of parenteral amphotericin B. The cure rate for miltefosine was approximately equivalent to historical cure rates using parenteral pentavalent antimony for mild and extensive disease in neighboring Peru. Although gastrointestinal side reactions do occur with miltefosine, its toxicity profile is superior to that of antimony and far superior to that of amphotericin B--in part because of the inherent attractiveness of oral versus parenteral agents. Our results suggest that miltefosine should be the treatment of choice for mucosal disease in North and South America.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Miltefosine is the only oral drug available for treatment of Indian visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which was shown to have an efficacy of 94\% in a phase III trial in the Indian subcontinent. Its unrestricted use has raised concern about its continued effectiveness. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of miltefosine for the treatment of VL after a decade of use in India.
METHODS: An open-label, noncomparative study was performed in which 567 patients received oral miltefosine (50 mg for patients weighing {\textless}25 kg, 100 mg in divided doses for those weighing ≥25 kg, and 2.5 mg per kg for those aged {\textless}12 years, daily for 28 days) in a directly observed manner. Patients were followed up for 6 months to see the response to therapy.
RESULTS: At the end of treatment the initial cure rate was 97.5\% (intention to treat), and 6 months after the end of treatment the final cure rate was 90.3\%. The overall death rate was 0.9\% (5 of 567), and 2 deaths were related to drug toxicity. Gastrointestinal intolerance was frequent (64.5\%). The drug was interrupted in 9 patients (1.5\%) because of drug-associated adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: As compared to the phase III trial that led to registration of the drug a decade ago, there is a substantial increase in the failure rate of oral miltefosine for treatment of VL in India.},

The aim of the present study was to examine the activity of hexadecylphosphocholine (HePC; miltefosine), a membrane-active alkylphospholipid, that is licensed as an antileishmanial agent against T. vaginalis.Methods: The efficacy of HePC after 30 min, 1 h, 16 h and 24 h against four different T. vaginalis strains (with varying resistance to metronidazole) was evaluated.Results: It was shown that all isolates, including the metronidazole-resistant strains, were susceptible to HePC, with EC50s of between 8 and 40 μM and EC90s of between 8 and 80 μM depending on time and on the medium used for the experiments. Treatment of trichomonads with HePC resulted in rounding up and, at concentrations of ≥40 μM, in subsequent total lysis of the organisms.Conclusions: HePC may be a promising new candidate for the treatment of trichomoniasis.},

	abstract = {Leishmania donovani is an intracellular protozoan parasite that causes leishmaniasis, which can range from a self-healing cutaneous disease to a fatal visceral disease depending on the infecting species. Miltefosine is currently the latest and only oral antileishmanial that came out of drug discovery pipelines in the past few decades, but recent reports indicate a significant decline in its efficacy against visceral leishmaniasis (also known as kala-azar) in the Indian subcontinent. This relapse rate of up to 20\% within 12 months after treatment was shown not to be related to reinfection, drug quality, drug exposure, or drug-resistant parasites. We therefore aimed to assess other phenotypes of the parasite that may affect treatment outcome and found a significant association between the number of metacyclic parasites, parasite infectivity, and patient treatment outcome in the Indian subcontinent. Together with previous studies on resistance of L. donovani against pentavalent antimonials, these data suggest that the infectivity of the parasite, or related phenotypes, might be a more determinant factor for treatment failure in visceral leishmaniasis than drug susceptibility, warranting a reassessment of our current view on treatment failure and drug resistance in leishmaniasis and beyond., The high miltefosine relapse rate poses a major challenge for the current Kala-Azar Elimination Program in the Indian subcontinent and other leishmaniasis control programs worldwide. This relapse rate could not be related to reinfection, drug-resistant parasites, or reduced treatment quality. Here we report that an increased infectivity of the parasite is associated with miltefosine relapse of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients. These results supplement those obtained with antimonial-resistant L. donovani where an increased infectivity was also observed. This challenges the current view of Leishmania drug susceptibility being the biggest parasitic factor that contributes to treatment failure in leishmaniasis. These selected more infectious parasites may pose an additional burden to leishmaniasis control programs, highlighting the importance of multifaceted control measures to achieve leishmaniasis elimination in the Indian subcontinent and other regions where leishmaniasis is endemic.},

Over the past decade, the number of countries reporting falsified (fake, spurious/falsely labeled/counterfeit) medicines and the types and quantities of fraudulent drugs being distributed have increased greatly. The obstacles in combating falsified pharmaceuticals include 1) lack of consensus on definitions, 2) paucity of reliable and scalable technology to detect fakes before they reach patients, 3) poor global and national leadership and accountability systems for combating this scourge, and 4) deficient manufacturing and regulatory challenges, especially in China and India where fake products often originate. The major needs to improve the quality of the world's medicines fall into three main areas: 1) research to develop and compare accurate and affordable tools to identify high-quality drugs at all levels of distribution; 2) an international convention and national legislation to facilitate production and utilization of high-quality drugs and protect all countries from the criminal and the negligent who make, distribute, and sell life-threatening products; and 3) a highly qualified, well-supported international science and public health organization that will establish standards, drug-quality surveillance, and training programs like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Such leadership would give authoritative guidance for countries in cooperation with national medical regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical companies, and international agencies, all of which have an urgent interest and investment in ensuring that patients throughout the world have access to good quality medicines. The organization would also advocate strongly for including targets for achieving good quality medicines in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals.},

	abstract = {In cancer chemotherapy neutropenia is a common dose-limiting toxicity. An ability to predict the neutropenic effects of cytotoxic agents based on proposed trial designs and models conditioned on previous studies would be valuable. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of a semi-mechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model for myelosuppression to predict the neutropenia observed in Phase I clinical studies, based on parameter estimates obtained from prior trials. Pharmacokinetic and neutropenia data from 5 clinical trials for diflomotecan and from 4 clinical trials for indisulam were used. Data were analyzed and simulations were performed using the population approach with NONMEM VI. Parameter sets were estimated under the following scenarios: (a) data from each trial independently, (b) pooled data from all clinical trials and (c) pooled data from trials performed before the tested trial. Model performance in each of the scenarios was evaluated by means of predictive (visual and numerical) checks. The semi-mechanistic PK/PD model for neutropenia showed adequate predictive ability for both anti-cancer agents. For diflomotecan, similar predictions were obtained for the three scenarios. For indisulam predictions were better when based on data from the specific study, however when the model parameters were conditioned on data from trials performed prior to a specific study, similar predictions of the drug related-neutropenia profiles and descriptors were obtained as when all data were used. This work provides further indication that modeling and simulation tools can be applied in the early stages of drug development to optimize future trials.},

	abstract = {Dichloroacetic acid (DCA) is a contaminant of chlorinated drinking water supplies, is carcinogenic in rats and mice, and is a therapeutic agent used for the treatment of congenital lactic acidosis. The biotransformation of DCA to glyoxylic acid is catalyzed by glutathione transferase zeta (GSTZ). Treatment of rats and human subjects with DCA increases its plasma elimination half-life and reduces the extent of DCA biotransformation in rat hepatic cytosol. In the investigation presented here, the kinetics of the DCA-induced inactivation of GSTZ, the turnover of GSTZ, and the susceptibility of GSTZ to inactivation by a panel of alpha-haloacids were studied. DCA rapidly inactivated GSTZ in both rat hepatic cytosol and intact Fischer 344 rats. The time course of inactivation in vivo was mirrored by a concomitant loss of immunoreactive GSTZ protein. The turnover of GSTZ in rat liver was 0.21 day(-1), which corresponded to a half-life of 3.3 days. The degree of GSTZ inactivation after daily administration of DCA could be predicted from the amount of inactivation after a single treatment. Other fluorine-lacking dihaloacetic acids also inactivated GSTZ, whereas alpha-monohaloacids and fluorine-containing dihaloacetic acids failed to inactivate GSTZ. These data show that the observed DCA-induced decrease in the level of DCA metabolism is caused by the inactivation of GSTZ.},

The development of intestinal lesions induced by indomethacin was accompanied by increases in intestinal motility, enterobacterial invasion, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity, together with the up-regulation of COX-2 and iNOS mRNA expression. Neither SC-560, a selective COX-1 inhibitor, nor rofecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, alone caused intestinal damage, but their combined administration provoked lesions in the small intestine. SC-560, but not rofecoxib, caused intestinal hypermotility, bacterial invasion and the expression of COX-2 as well as iNOS mRNA, yet the iNOS and MPO activity was increased only when rofecoxib was administered together with SC-560. Although SC-560 inhibited PG production, the level of PGE(2) recovered in a rofecoxib-dependent manner. The intestinal hypermotility in response to indomethacin was prevented by both 16,16-dimethyl PGE(2) and atropine but not by ampicillin, yet all these agents inhibited not only the bacterial invasion but also the expression of COX-2 as well as the iNOS activity in the intestinal mucosa following indomethacin treatment, thereby preventing the intestinal damage. These results suggest that inhibition of COX-1, despite causing intestinal hypermotility, bacterial invasion and iNOS expression, up-regulates the expression of COX-2, and the PGE(2) derived from COX-2 counteracts the deleterious events caused by COX-1 inhibition and maintains mucosal integrity. These sequences of events explain why intestinal damage occurs when both COX-1 and COX-2 are inhibited.},

For this indication and in subsequent development for leishmaniasis, a large body of non-clinical data has been generated. The gastrointestinal organ is the main site of toxicity, in both animal and in human studies. The testis and retina were identified as target organs in rats, although corresponding changes were not observed in clinical studies in humans. In terms of pharmacokinetics, the terminal elimination half-life is long (84 h and 159 h in rats and dogs respectively). Miltefosine is widely distributed in body organs and not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro. The drug is embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rats and rabbits, and teratogenic in rats but not in rabbits. It is therefore contraindicated for use during pregnancy, and contraception is required beyond the end of treatment in women of child-bearing age.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, some clinical studies have suggested that MLF shows significantly less efficiency against the cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania braziliensis. In this work, we have determined the cellular and molecular basis for the natural MLF resistance observed in L. braziliensis. Four independent L. braziliensis clinical isolates showed a marked decrease in MLF sensitivity that was due to their inability to internalize the drug. MLF internalization in the highly sensitive L. donovani species requires at least two proteins in the plasma membrane, LdMT, a P-type ATPase involved in phospholipid translocation, and its β subunit, LdRos3. Strikingly, L. braziliensis parasites showed highly reduced levels of this MLF translocation machinery at the plasma membrane, mainly because of the low expression levels of the β subunit, LbRos3. Overexpression of LbRos3 induces increased MLF sensitivity not only in L. braziliensis promastigotes but also in intracellular amastigotes. These results further highlight the importance of the MLF translocation machinery in determining MLF potency and point toward the development of protocols to routinely monitor MLF susceptibility in geographic areas where L. braziliensis might be prevalent.},

The aims of this study were to validate a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to quantify miltefosine in dried blood spot (DBS) samples and to validate its use with Ethiopian patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Since hematocrit (Ht) levels are typically severely decreased in VL patients, returning to normal during treatment, the method was evaluated over a range of clinically relevant Ht values. Miltefosine was extracted from DBS samples using a simple method of pretreatment with methanol, resulting in {\textgreater}97\% recovery. The method was validated over a calibration range of 10 to 2,000 ng/ml, and accuracy and precision were within ±11.2\% and ≤7.0\% (≤19.1\% at the lower limit of quantification), respectively. The method was accurate and precise for blood spot volumes between 10 and 30 μl and for Ht levels of 20 to 35\%, although a linear effect of Ht levels on miltefosine quantification was observed in the bioanalytical validation. DBS samples were stable for at least 162 days at 37°C. Clinical validation of the method using paired DBS and plasma samples from 16 VL patients showed a median observed DBS/plasma miltefosine concentration ratio of 0.99, with good correlation (Pearson'sr= 0.946). Correcting for patient-specific Ht levels did not further improve the concordance between the sampling methods. This successfully validated method to quantify miltefosine in DBS samples was demonstrated to be a valid and practical alternative to venous blood sampling that can be applied in future miltefosine pharmacokinetic studies with leishmaniasis patients, without Ht correction.},

The library is object oriented and written in the programming language Perl. The classes of the library are built around NONMEM's data, model and output files. The specification of the NONMEM model is easily set or changed through the model and data file classes while the output from a model fit is accessed through the output file class. The classes have methods that help the programmer perform common repetitive tasks, e.g. summarising the output from a NONMEM run, setting the initial estimates of a model based on a previous run or truncating values over a certain threshold in the data file. PsN creates a basis for the development of high-level software using NONMEM as the regression tool.},

Susceptibility to amphotericin B did not differ across the various axenic models (50\% inhibitory concentrations [IC50], 0.6 to 0.7 microM), and amphotericin B showed slightly higher potency against intracellular amastigotes (IC50, 0.1 to 0.4 microM). A similar trend was observed for miltefosine, with comparable efficacies against the extracellular (IC50, 0.4 to 3.8 microM) and intracellular (IC50, 0.9 to 4.3 microM) stages. Sodium stibogluconate, used either as Pentostam or as a crystalline substance, was inactive against all axenic stages (IC50, {\textgreater}64 microg SbV/ml) but showed good efficacy against intracellular amastigotes (IC50, 22 to 28 microg SbV/ml); the crystalline substance was about two to three times more potent (IC50, 9 to 11 microg SbV/ml). The activity profile of PX-6518 was comparable to that of sodium stibogluconate, but at a much higher potency (IC50, 0.1 microg/ml). In conclusion, the differential susceptibility determines which in vitro models are appropriate for either drug screening or resistance monitoring of clinical field isolates. Despite the more complex and labor-intensive protocol, the current results support the intracellular amastigote model as the gold standard for in vitro Leishmania drug discovery research and for evaluation of the resistance of field strains, since it also includes host cell-mediated effects. Axenic systems can be recommended only for compounds for which no cellular mechanisms are involved, for example, amphotericin B and miltefosine.},

It is the first and still the only oral drug that can be used to treat VL and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). The standard 28 day miltefosine monotherapy regimen is well tolerated, except for mild gastrointestinal side effects, although its teratogenic potential severely hampers its general use in the clinic and roll-out in national elimination programmes. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine are mainly characterized by its long residence time in the body, resulting in extensive drug accumulation during treatment and long elimination half-lives. At the moment, different combination therapy strategies encompassing miltefosine are being tested in multiple controlled clinical trials in various geographical areas of endemicity, both in South Asia and East Africa. We here review the most salient pre-clinical and clinical pharmacological aspects of miltefosine, its mechanism of action against Leishmania parasites and other pathogens, and provide a systematic overview of the efficacy and safety data from all clinical trials of miltefosine, either alone or in combination, in the treatment of VL and CL.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the likelihood-based methods for handling data below the quantification limit (BQL) using new features in NONMEM VI.
METHODS: A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption was chosen for investigation. Methods evaluated were: discarding BQL observations (M1), discarding BQL observations but adjusting the likelihood for the remaining data (M2), maximizing the likelihood for the data above the limit of quantification (LOQ) and treating BQL data as censored (M3), and like M3 but conditioning on the observation being greater than zero (M4). These four methods were compared using data simulated with a proportional error model. M2, M3, and M4 were also compared using data simulated from a positively truncated normal distribution. Successful terminations and bias and precision of parameter estimates were assessed.
RESULTS: For the data simulated with a proportional error model, the overall performance was best for M3 followed by M2 and M1. M3 and M4 resulted in similar estimates in analyses without log transformation. For data simulated with the truncated normal distribution, M4 performed better than M3.
CONCLUSIONS: Analyses that maximized the likelihood of the data above the LOQ and treated BQL data as censored provided the most accurate and precise parameter estimates.},

Results  Of the 188 tablet packs purchased which were labelled as ‘artesunate’ 53\% did not contain any artesunate. All counterfeit artesunate tablets were labelled as manufactured by ‘Guilin Pharma’, and refinements of the fake blisterpacks made them often hard to distinguish from their genuine counterparts. No other artemisinin derivatives were found to be counterfeited. Of the 44 mefloquine samples, 9\% contained {\textless}10\% of the expected amount of active ingredient.

As their records cover some of the co-infection cases that occurred before and after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced into Spain, retrospective analysis of the records has allowed some of the effects of HAART on local VL to be determined. Encouragingly, HAART appears to have decreased the annual incidence of VL among local AIDS cases, from 4.81 cases/100 to just 0.8 case/100 (P {\textless}0.0005), a first episode of VL now appearing only when there is obvious HAART failure. Unfortunately, it does not seem to be very good at preventing VL relapses; within 24 months of antileishmanial treatment, 70\% of patients who were receiving HAART had such relapses. The mean time between antileishmanial treatment and VL relapse was, however, longer when HAART was used than when it was not (20 v. 13 months). In those receiving HAART, relapses of the VL often occurred despite increasing CD4+ cell counts and undetectable HIV loads, indicating that successful treatment of the viral infection is insufficient to prevent the relapse of the leishmaniasis. These results are in general agreement with other observations made in Spain. VL relapses are possible and even frequent in HIV-positives who have no more than 200 CD4+ cells/microl, but secondary prophylaxis to prevent VL relapses may be safely suspended if a CD4+ count of {\textgreater}200 cells/microl can be maintained using HAART. VL also seems to hamper the immunological recovery of the HIV-positive, although HAART appears to have little effect on the clinical manifestations of VL.},

MIL is a simple molecule, very stable, relatively safe and highly efficient in clinical trials. However, MIL requires a long treatment course (28 days) and has a long half-life (around 150h), which might accelerate the emergence of drug resistance in case of inadequate use. The mechanisms of MIL resistance have been studied in vitro with experimental resistant lines. Resistance was shown to develop quickly in Leishmania promastigotes. Interestingly, a decreased MIL accumulation has always accounted for the resistance phenotype. The lower MIL accumulation can be achieved by two independent mechanisms: (i) an increase in drug efflux, mediated by the overexpression of the ABC transporter P-glycoprotein, and (ii) a decrease in drug uptake, which is easily achieved by the inactivation of any one of the two proteins known to be responsible for the MIL uptake, the MIL transporter LdMT and its beta subunit LdRos3. Policies concerning a proper use of this drug should be followed and supervised by health authorities of endemic areas to minimalize the risk for the appearance of drug failures and to ensure a long life span for this effective oral drug.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a major health problem in developing countries. The untreated disease is fatal, available treatment is expensive and often toxic, and drug resistance is increasing. Improved treatment options are needed. Paromomycin was shown to be an efficacious first-line treatment with low toxicity in India.


METHODS

This was a 3-arm multicentre, open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial to compare three treatment regimens for VL in East Africa: paromomycin sulphate (PM) at 15 mg/kg/day for 21 days versus sodium stibogluconate (SSG) at 20 mg/kg/day for 30 days; and the combination of both dose regimens for 17 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was cure based on parasite-free tissue aspirates taken 6 months after treatment.


FINDINGS

Overall, 135 patients per arm were enrolled at five centres in Sudan (2 sites), Kenya (1) and Ethiopia (2), when the PM arm had to be discontinued due to poor efficacy. The trial has continued with the higher dose of PM as well as the combination of PM and SSG arms. These results will be reported later. Baseline patient characteristics were similar among treatment arms. The overall cure with PM was significantly inferior to that with SSG (63.8\% versus 92.2\%; difference 28.5\%, 95\%CI 18.8\% to 38.8\%, p{\textless}0.001). The efficacy of PM varied among centres and was significantly lower in Sudan (14.3\% and 46.7\%) than in Kenya (80.0\%) and Ethiopia (75.0\% and 96.6\%). No major safety issues with PM were identified.


CONCLUSION

The efficacy of PM at 15 mg/kg/day for 21 days was inadequate, particularly in Sudan. The efficacy of higher doses and the combination treatment warrant further studies.},

With respect to the targeting of macrophage modulators at the mononuclear phagocyte system by means of liposomes for maximal stimulation of the nonspecific antimicrobial resistance, experimental evidence is now available of the potential usefulness of liposomes as carriers of these agents.

	abstract = {Liposomes containing antimonial compounds trapped in the aqueous phase were tested in the treatment of experimental leishmaniasis. The rationale of this approach was based on the hypothesis that the liposomes and the parasite are taken up by the same cell, the reticuloendothelial cell, and we present electron microscopic evidence that supports this hypothesis. Suppression of leishmaniasis was quantified by determining the total number of parasites per liver from impression smears. When two antimonials, meglumine antimoniate and sodium stibogluconate, were encapsulated within liposomes, each was more than 700 times more active compared to either of the free (unencapsulated) drugs. After infection, if untreated, all of the hamsters eventually would die from the disease. Liposome-encapsulated meglumine antimoniate was about 330-640 times more effective in causing a drop in the death rate than was the free antimonial. The efficacy of treatment was influenced by the lipid composition and charge of the liposomes. For example, positively charged liposomes containing egg phosphatidylcholine were much less effective than negatively charged ones. In contrast, positively and negatively charged sphingomyelin liposomes were equally effective. Liposomes containing phosphatidylserine (which were negatively charged, but also had a much higher charge density) were among the less-effective preparations. Among those tested, the most consistently efficacious liposomes contained highly saturated long-chain phospholipids (eg., dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine), cholesterol, and a negative charge.

We conclude that liposomes may be useful as carriers of drugs to treat infectious diseases involving the reticuloendothelial system. The toxicities of antimony are very similar to those of arsenic. Encapsulation of antimonial drugs and reduction of the dose required for effective therapy should minimize such systemic toxicities as acute cardiomyopathy and toxic nephritis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The poor ocular bioavailability of the conventional eye drops is due to lack of corneal permeability, nasolacrimal drainage and metabolic degradation. To overcome this issue, drug encapsulated in mucoadhesive polymer based ocular microspheres have the advantages of improved drug stability, easy administration in liquid form, diffuse rapidly and better ocular tissue internalization.
METHODS: The ganciclovir chitosan microspheres (GCM) were prepared by modified water-in-oil emulsification method. The formulation was optimized and characterized by investigating in vitro release study, release kinetics, XRD and microspheres stability. Ocular irritancy, in vivo ocular pharmacokinetic parameters and histopathology study was evaluated in Wistar rats. The use of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic indices and simulation process was carried out to further ensure clinical applicability of the formulation.
RESULTS: The in vitro release study showed initial burst (nearly 50 \%) in first few minutes and followed Fickian (R(2) = 0.9234, n-value = 0.2329) type of diffusion release mechanism. The XRD and stability studies showed favorable results. The Wistar rat eyes treated with GCM showed significant increase in ganciclovir AUC ({\textasciitilde}4.99-fold) and Cmax (2.69-fold) in aqueous humor compared to ganciclovir solution and delay in Tmax. The Cmax/MIC90, AUC0-24/MIC90, AUC above MIC90 and T above MIC90 were significantly higher in GCM group. The aqueous humor concentration-time profile of ganciclovir in GCM and ganciclovir solution was simulated with every 28.1 and 12.8 h, respectively. The simulated concentration-time profile shows that in duration of 75 h, the ganciclovir solution require six ocular instillations compared to three ocular instillations of the GCM formulation. The photomicrograph of GCM and ganciclovir solution treated rat retina showed normal organization and cytoarchitecture.
CONCLUSIONS: Correlating with in vitro data, the formulation showed sustained drug release along with improved intraocular bioavailability of ganciclovir in Wistar rats.},

	abstract = {Metabolic rate, heart rate, lifespan, and many other physiological properties vary with body mass in systematic and interrelated ways. Present empirical data suggest that these scaling relationships take the form of power laws with exponents that are simple multiples of one quarter. A compelling explanation of this observation was put forward a decade ago by West, Brown, and Enquist (WBE). Their framework elucidates the link between metabolic rate and body mass by focusing on the dynamics and structure of resource distribution networks-the cardiovascular system in the case of mammals. Within this framework the WBE model is based on eight assumptions from which it derives the well-known observed scaling exponent of 3/4. In this paper we clarify that this result only holds in the limit of infinite network size (body mass) and that the actual exponent predicted by the model depends on the sizes of the organisms being studied. Failure to clarify and to explore the nature of this approximation has led to debates about the WBE model that were at cross purposes. We compute analytical expressions for the finite-size corrections to the 3/4 exponent, resulting in a spectrum of scaling exponents as a function of absolute network size. When accounting for these corrections over a size range spanning the eight orders of magnitude observed in mammals, the WBE model predicts a scaling exponent of 0.81, seemingly at odds with data. We then proceed to study the sensitivity of the scaling exponent with respect to variations in several assumptions that underlie the WBE model, always in the context of finite-size corrections. Here too, the trends we derive from the model seem at odds with trends detectable in empirical data. Our work illustrates the utility of the WBE framework in reasoning about allometric scaling, while at the same time suggesting that the current canonical model may need amendments to bring its predictions fully in line with available datasets.},

	issn = {1746-6148},
	doi = {10.1186/s12917-015-0486-6},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In order to provide some basis for effective dosage regimens that optimize efficacy with respect to bacteriological and clinical cures, the in vivo activity of cefquinome against a clinical Escherichia coli (E.coli) strain (the minimum inhibitory concentration value for this strain equals to the MIC90 value of 0.25 μg/ml for 210 E.coli strains isolated from pigs) was investigated by using a piglet tissue-cage infection model. The aim was to elucidate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) index associated with cefquinome efficacy, and then to identify the magnitude of the PK/PD parameter required for different degree of efficacy in clinical treatment.
RESULTS: Tissue-cage infection model was established in piglets, and then the animals received intramuscular injection of cefquinome twice a day for 3 days to create a range of different drug exposures. The tissue-cage fluid was collected at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 h after every drug administration for drug concentrationdetermination and bacteria counting. Different cefquinome regimens produced different percentages of time during that drug concentrations exceeded the MIC (\%T {\textgreater} MIC), ranging from 0\% to 100\%. Cefquinome administration at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg reduced the bacterial count (log10 CFU/mL) in tissue-cage fluid by -1.00 ± 0.32, -1.83 ± 0.08, -2.33 ± 0.04, -2.96 ± 0.16, -2.99 ± 0.16, -2.93 ± 0.11, -3.43 ± 0.18, respectively. The correlation coefficient of the PK/PD index with antibacterial effect of the drug was 0.90 for \%T {\textgreater} MIC, 0.62 for AUC0-12/MIC, and 0.61 for Cmax/MIC, suggesting the most important PK/PD parameter was \%T {\textgreater} MIC. A inhibitory form of sigmoid maximum effect (Emax) model was used to estimate \%T {\textgreater} MIC, and the respective values required for continuous 1/6-log drop, 1/3-log drop and 1/2-log drop of the clinical E.coli count during each 12 h treatment period were 3.97\%, 17.08\% and 52.68\%.
CONCLUSIONS: The data derived from this study showed that cefquinome exhibited time-dependent killing profile. And from the results of the present study, it can be assumed that when \%T {\textgreater} MIC reached 52.68\%, cefquinome could be expected to be effective against a clinical E.coli strain for which the MIC value is below 0.128 μg/ml (3-log drop of bacteria count can be achieved after six successive administrations for 3 days).},

Parasite density in splenic aspirate smears was graded on a logarithmic scale from 0 (no parasites in 1,000 microscopic fields) to 6+ (greater than 100 parasites per microscopic field). Among 46 newly diagnosed and 17 relapsed or drug-resistant patients with visceral leishmaniasis, the average initial parasite grade was 4.35 +/- 0.92 (mean +/- SD) and 4.15 +/- 1.37, respectively. The grading system was useful in measuring the speed of response to treatment, and in distinguishing slow responders from nonresponders. This was especially valuable for managing patients with drug-resistant visceral leishmaniasis. The system also provided a means of comparing the efficacy of different treatment regimens, and for calculating the optimum duration of treatment.},

The following characteristics appear to be exhibited by patients who are at high risk for developing corticosteroid-induced ulcers: corticosteroids coadministered with NSAIDs, a total dosage greater than 1000 mg of prednisone equivalent, a duration of therapy longer than 30 days, and a history of PUD. Further prospective research examining the association of corticosteroids and PUD in conjunction with other contributing factors is needed. The role of prophylactic therapy to prevent corticosteroid-induced ulcers is not well established. Even though a small study in liver transplant recipients, who are already at increased risk for GI ulceration, has suggested beneficial effects with prophylactic regimens, generalization of these results to all corticosteroid-treated patients would be inappropriate. Large prospective trials to determine the most efficacious prophylactic regimen (e.g., histamine2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, cytoprotective agents [misoprostol]) for corticosteroid-induced ulcerations are not currently available. We suggest that most prophylaxis currently performed is unnecessary. In high-risk patients, however, prophylaxis appears to be prudent until further information is available.},

	abstract = {The antitumor drug miltefosine has been recently approved as the first oral drug active against visceral leishmaniasis. We have previously identified the L. donovani miltefosine transporter (LdMT) as a P-type ATPase involved in phospholipid translocation at the plasma membrane of Leishmania parasites. Here we show that this protein is essential but not sufficient for the phospholipid translocation activity and, thus, for the potency of the drug. Based on recent findings in yeast, we have identified the putative beta subunit of LdMT, named LdRos3, as another protein factor required for the translocation activity. LdRos3 belongs to the CDC50/Lem3 family, proposed as likely beta subunits for P4-ATPases. The phenotype of LdRos3-defective parasites was identical to that of the LdMT-/-, including a defect in the uptake of 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl-amino)-phosphatidylserine, generally considered as not affected in Lem3p-deficient yeast. Both LdMT and LdRos3 normally localized to the plasma membrane but were retained inside the endoplasmic reticulum in the absence of the other protein or when inactivating point mutations were introduced in LdMT. Modulating the expression levels of either protein independently, we show that any one of them could behave as the protein limiting the level of flippase activity. Thus, LdMT and LdRos3 seem to form part of the same translocation machinery that determines flippase activity and miltefosine sensitivity in Leishmania, further supporting the consideration of CDC50/Lem3 proteins as beta subunits required for the normal functioning of P4-ATPases.},

The method is based on the lysing and nuclease-inactivating properties of the chaotropic agent guanidinium thiocyanate together with the nucleic acid-binding properties of silica particles or diatoms in the presence of this agent. By using size-fractionated silica particles, nucleic acids (covalently closed circular, relaxed circular, and linear double-stranded DNA; single-stranded DNA; and rRNA) could be purified from 12 different specimens in less than 1 h and were recovered in the initial reaction vessel. Purified DNA (although significantly sheared) was a good substrate for restriction endonucleases and DNA ligase and was recovered with high yields (usually over 50\%) from the picogram to the microgram level. Copurified rRNA was recovered almost undegraded. Substituting size-fractionated silica particles for diatoms (the fossilized cell walls of unicellular algae) allowed for the purification of microgram amounts of genomic DNA, plasmid DNA, and rRNA from cell-rich sources, as exemplified for pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. In this paper, we show representative experiments illustrating some characteristics of the procedure which may have wide application in clinical microbiology.},

	abstract = {Serologic tests have been widely used for the diagnosis of asymptomatic visceral leishmaniasis. This study evaluated five serologic tests used for the diagnosis of asymptomatic infection: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using promastigote antigen (ELISAp), ELISA using recombinant K39 (ELISA rK39), and K26 (ELISA rK26) antigens, an indirect immunofluorescence test using Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis promastigote antigen (IIFT), and an immunochromatographic test using rK39 antigen (TRALd). As a reference regarding the performance of the tests, patients with classic visceral leishmaniasis originating from Minas Gerais, Brazil (N = 36), were defined as the positive group and samples of healthy individuals from nonendemic areas (Argentina) (N = 127) were used as negative controls. Patients with other diseases such as cutaneous leishmaniasis (N = 53) and malaria (N = 56) were also studied to evaluate the chance of cross-reactivity in these tests. Finally, subjects from an area endemic for visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil (Porteirinha, northern Minas Gerais) (N = 1241) were screened for asymptomatic infection with Leishmania and Chagas disease. The sensitivity of the serologic tests was 50\% (18/36), 66.7\% (24/36), 69.4\% (25/36), 83.3\% (30/36), and 88.9\% (32/36) for ELISAp, ELISA rK26, ELISA rK39, IIFT, and TRALd, respectively. Specificity, calculated using the truly negative group, was 96\% (122/127) for TRALd, 97.6\% (124/127) for ELISAp and IIFT, and 100\% (127/127) for ELISA rK39 and rK26. Positivity in at least one test employing recombinant antigen was observed in 24 (45\%) patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis and 47 (82.4\%) with malaria. In the visceral leishmaniasis-endemic area, the positivity of the serologic tests ranged from 3.9\% to 37.5\%. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests using recombinant antigens were more frequently positive in subjects with a history of exposure to human or canine visceral leishmaniasis (ELISArK39: 14.6\% [149/1017] versus 37.5\% [84/224]; ELISA rK26: 12.7\% [129/1017] versus 21.4\% [48/224], P {\textless} 0.001 for both). Kappa agreement was low, with a maximum value of 0.449 between ELISAp and IIFT. In addition, among the 112 IIFT-positive subjects, 75 (67\%) also presented positive serology for Chagas disease. In conclusion, IIFT and TRALd presented the best performance to diagnose classic cases of visceral leishmaniasis in an endemic area. Cross-reactivity of the tests with Chagas disease, cutaneous leishmaniasis, and malaria should be taken into account. However, the differences in the positivity of the tests used, together with the low agreement between results, do not permit to select the best test for the diagnosis of asymptomatic Leishmania infection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Treatment options for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in East Africa are far from satisfactory due to cost, toxicity, prolonged treatment duration or emergence of parasite resistance. Hence there is a need to explore alternative treatment protocols such as miltefosine alone or in combinations including miltefosine, sodium stibogluconate (SSG) or liposomal amphotericin B. The aim of this trial is to identify regimen(s) which are sufficiently promising for future trials in East Africa.


METHODS/DESIGN

A phase II randomized, parallel arm, open-labelled trial is being conducted to assess the efficacy of each of the three regimens: liposomal amphotericin B with SSG, Liposomal amphotericin B with miltefosine and miltefosine alone. The primary endpoint is cure at day 28 with secondary endpoint at day 210 (6 months). Initial cure is a single composite measure based on parasitologic evaluation (bone marrow, spleen or lymph node aspirate) and clinical assessment. Repeated interim analyses have been planned after recruitment of 15 patients in each arm with a maximum sample size of 63 for each. These will follow group-sequential methods (the triangular test) to identify when a regimen is inadequate ({\textless}75\% efficacy) or adequate ({\textgreater}90\% efficacy). We describe a method to ensure consistency of the sequential analysis of day 28 cure with the non-sequential analysis of day 210 cure.


DISCUSSION

A regimen with adequate efficacy would be a candidate for treatment of VL with reasonable costs. The design allows repeated testing throughout the trial recruitment period while maintaining good statistical properties (Type I \& II error rates) and reducing the expected sample sizes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) affects large, rural, resource-poor populations in South Asia, Africa, and Brazil. Safe, effective, and affordable new therapies are needed. We conducted a randomized, controlled, phase 3 open-label study comparing paromomycin, an aminoglycoside, with amphotericin B, the present standard of care in Bihar, India.


METHODS

In four treatment centers for visceral leishmaniasis, 667 patients between 5 and 55 years of age who were negative for the human immunodeficiency virus and had parasitologically confirmed visceral leishmaniasis were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive paromomycin (502 patients) at a dose of 11 mg per kilogram of body weight intramuscularly daily for 21 days or amphotericin B (165 patients) at a dose of 1 mg per kilogram intravenously every other day for 30 days. Final cure was assessed 6 months after the end of treatment; safety assessments included daily clinical evaluations and weekly laboratory and audiometric evaluations. Noninferiority testing was used to compare 6-month cure rates, with a chosen margin of noninferiority of 10 percentage points.


RESULTS

Paromomycin was shown to be noninferior to amphotericin B (final cure rate, 94.6\% vs. 98.8\%; difference, 4.2 percentage points; upper bound of the 97.5\% confidence interval, 6.9; P{\textless}0.001). Mortality rates in the two groups were less than 1\%. Adverse events, which were more common among patients receiving paromomycin than among those receiving amphotericin B (6\% vs. 2\%, P=0.02), included transient elevation of aspartate aminotransferase levels ({\textgreater}3 times the upper limit of the normal range); transient reversible ototoxicity (2\% vs. 0, P=0.20); and injection-site pain (55\% vs. 0, P{\textless}0.001); and in patients receiving amphotericin B, as compared with those receiving paromomycin, nephrotoxicity (4\% vs. 0, P{\textless}0.001), fevers (57\% vs. 3\%), rigors (24\% vs. 0, P{\textless}0.001), and vomiting (10\% vs. {\textless}1\%, P{\textless}0.001).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES

To evaluate the in vitro activity of anti-leishmanial drugs against intracellular Leishmania donovani amastigotes in different types of macrophages.


METHODS

Mouse peritoneal macrophages (PEMs), mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMPhi), human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (PBM Phi) and differentiated THP-1 cells were infected with L. donovani. Cultures were incubated with sodium stibogluconate, amphotericin B deoxycholate (Fungizone), miltefosine or paromomycin sulphate over six concentrations in 3-fold serial dilutions for 5 days. Analysis was based on percentage inhibition of infected macrophages and EC(50)/EC(90) values estimated using sigmoidal curve-fitting.


RESULTS

The rank order of drug activity was the same in the different macrophage populations: amphotericin B {\textgreater} miltefosine {\textgreater} sodium stibogluconate {\textgreater} paromomycin. However, significant (P {\textless} 0.05) differences were observed between populations. Amphotericin B was more active in PEMs and BMM Phi (EC(50) 0.02-0.06 microM) compared with PBM Phi and differentiated THP-1 cells (EC(50) 0.08-0.40 microM) and miltefosine was more active in PBM Phi (EC(50) 0.16-0.74 microM) compared with PEMs and BMM Phi (EC(50) 2.60-7.67 microM). Sodium stibogluconate displayed highest activity in PBM Phi (EC(50) 1.38-1.89 microg Sb(v)/mL), followed by PEMs (EC(50) 21.75-27.79 microg Sb(v)/mL) and BMM Phi and differentiated THP-1 cells (EC(50) 28.96-112.77 microg Sb(v)/mL). Paromomycin showed highest activity in PBM Phi (EC(50) 80.03-104.38 microM) and PEMs (EC(50) 75.42-201.63 microM).


CONCLUSIONS

In vitro activity of anti-leishmanial drugs is host cell dependent. This has implications for: (i) the evaluation of in vitro drug activity; (ii) the evaluation of drug susceptibility of clinical isolates; and (iii) the standardization of anti-leishmanial drug assays.},

Our objective was to evaluate oral miltefosine for its potential to provide effective as well as tolerable treatment for this disease.
METHOD: Open-label, randomised, parallel-group multicentric trial. Miltefosine, 100 mg/day to all but one patient, was administered for 12 weeks or 8 weeks, with a target of 18 patients in each treatment group. Key endpoints were tolerance during treatment and efficacy at 12 months of follow-up.
RESULTS: The ITT and per-protocol cure rates after 12 months of follow-up for patients receiving 12 weeks of therapy were 78\% (14 of 18 patients: 95\% CI = 61-88\%) and 93\% (14 of 15 patients: 95\% CI = 71-95\%), respectively, after 12 months of follow-up. The ITT and per-protocol cure rates for patients receiving 8 weeks of therapy were 76\% (13 of 17 patients: 95\% CI = 53-90\%) and 81\% (13 of 16 patients: 95\% CI = 57-93\%), respectively.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Miltefosine (MIL), the only oral drug for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), is currently the first-line therapy in the VL elimination program of the Indian subcontinent. Given the paucity of anti-VL drugs and the looming threat of resistance, there is an obvious need for close monitoring of clinical efficacy of MIL.
METHODS: In a cohort study of 120 VL patients treated with MIL in Nepal, we monitored the clinical outcomes up to 12 months after completion of therapy and explored the potential role of drug compliance, parasite drug resistance, and reinfection.
RESULTS: The initial cure rate was 95.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 92.2-99.4) and the relapse rate at 6 and 12 months was 10.8\% (95\% CI, 5.2-16.4) and 20.0\% (95\% CI, 12.8-27.2) , respectively. No significant clinical risk factors of relapse apart from age {\textless}12 years were found. Parasite fingerprints of pretreatment and relapse bone marrow isolates within 8 patients were similar, suggesting that clinical relapses were not due to reinfection with a new strain. The mean promastigote MIL susceptibility (50\% inhibitory concentration) of isolates from definite cures was similar to that of relapses. Although more tolerant strains were observed, parasite resistance, as currently measured, is thus not likely involved in MIL treatment failure. Moreover, MIL blood levels at the end of treatment were similar in cured and relapsed patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Relapse in one-fifth of the MIL-treated patients observed in our study is an alarming signal for the VL elimination campaign, urging for further review and cohort monitoring.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Existing data on human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) due to Trypanosoma brucei gambiense among children are limited. Here, we described the demographic, clinical, diagnostic, treatment and outcome characteristics of HAT in pre-school children from Kajo-Keji County, South Sudan in comparison with older patients.


METHODS

We did a retrospective analysis of HAT patients treated at the Kiri Sleeping Sickness Treatment Centre (SSTC), Kajo-Keji County, from June 2000 to December 2002.


RESULTS

Of 1958 HAT patients, 119 (6.1\%) were pre-school children ({\textless}6 years) including 56 (47\%) in first-stage illness and 63 (53\%) in second-stage. The proportion of children in second-stage HAT was significantly higher in very young children ({\textless}2 years). Walking and speech disturbances were more frequent in second-stage HAT but other neurological symptoms and signs were not associated with disease stage. Pentamidine treatment for first-stage illness was very safe and effective among pre-school children. In contrast, 4.9\% of pre-school children in second-stage illness died during melarsoprol treatment and 46\% had {\textgreater} or = 1 severe adverse event(s). Macular rash, jaundice and skin necrosis on injection site were significantly more frequent in this age group (p{\textless}0.05). Melarsoprol-induced encephalopatic syndrome was less frequent but more severe than in older age groups.


CONCLUSION

The clinical features of T. b. gambiense HAT among pre-school children are insufficiently stage-specific. Therefore, laboratory-based staging is mandatory to prevent unnecessary harm to HAT patients caused by the high toxicity of melarsoprol.},

The cure rates with 6 months of follow-up were statistically similar: 36 of 41 evaluable miltefosine patients (88\%) versus 15 of 16 (94\%) evaluable antimony patients.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a cutaneous form of disease that develops at variable times after individuals have received treatment for clinical visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The study aimed to investigate the possible role of interleukin 10 (IL-10) and development of PKDL.
METHODS: 77 families composed of 41 complete case-parent trios and 36 case-parent pairs from the Masalit ethnic group were genotyped for 3 IL10 promoter polymorphisms: -1082A/G, -819C/T and -592C/A.
RESULTS: Single point analysis using the transmission disequilibrium test showed no evidence of association between any of these IL10 promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and development of PKDL. Haplotype analysis performed using TRANSMIT showed borderline significance between PKDL and the haplotype AA across -592C/A and -1082A/G (p = 0.053). Haplotypes GCC (0.33) and ATA (0.30) were the common haplotypes in this Sudanese population. Allele frequencies for the 3 SNPs differed significantly in Sudan compared to other African (Gambian, Malawian, YRI) populations.
CONCLUSION: There is no evidence for an association between 3 SNPs in the IL10 gene promoter and susceptibility to PKDL in the Masalit ethnic group in Sudan, although some evidence for haplotype association was observed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

There is no effective orally administered medication for any leishmania infection. We investigated miltefosine, which can be taken orally, for the treatment of Indian visceral leishmaniasis. Miltefosine is a phosphocholine analogue that affects cell-signaling pathways and membrane synthesis.


METHODS

The study was an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 trial in which four 30-person cohorts received 50, 100, or 150 mg of miltefosine per day for four or six weeks. The 120 patients, who ranged in age from 12 to 50 years, had anorexia, fever, and splenomegaly with at least moderate (2+) leishmania in a splenic aspirate. A parasitologic cure was defined by the absence of parasites in a splenic aspirate obtained two weeks after completion of treatment. The clinical response was assessed at six months.


RESULTS

In all 120 patients there was an initial parasitologic cure. Six patients had clinical and parasitologic relapses; the remaining 114 patients had not relapsed by six months after treatment, for a cure rate of 95 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 89 to 98 percent). With the regimen of 100 mg of miltefosine per day (approximately 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) for four weeks, 29 of 30 patients (97 percent) were cured. Gastrointestinal side effects were frequent (occurring in 62 percent of patients) but mild to moderate in severity, and no patient discontinued therapy because of gastrointestinal side effects. In two patients, treatment was discontinued because of elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase or creatinine; in both patients the levels rapidly returned to normal. In 12 other patients, the level of aspartate aminotransferase increased to 100 to 150 U per liter during treatment.


CONCLUSIONS

Orally administered miltefosine appears to be an effective treatment for Indian visceral leishmaniasis.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES

To assess the cost-effectiveness of current monotherapies and prospective combinations for treating visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Bihar, India in terms of years of life lost (YLL) averted as well as deaths averted.


METHODS

We employed two methods to estimate the number of avertable deaths in our analysis: one using estimated mortality, the other using direct incidence estimates for VL. Costs of care are based on an average private hospital in Bihar, and data on drug costs were obtained both locally and from the World Health Organization.


RESULTS

The cost of monotherapies per averted YLL ranged from US\$2 for paromomycin in an outpatient setting to US\$20-22 for AmBisome at 20 mg/kg. The corresponding costs per death averted ranged from US\$53-54 to US\$523-527. Combinations ranged US\$5-8 per YLL averted and US\$124-213 per death averted.


CONCLUSION

The available treatments for VL are cost-effective, and our mortality and incidence-based methods produce consistent estimates. The combinations considered here were more cost-effective than most monotherapies. Having multiple treatment options and combining drugs are also likely to reduce drug pressure and prolong the drugs' life-span of effective use.},

The direct activity of antileishmanials must therefore depend on intracellular drug transport, metabolism, and accumulation within the host cell. In this study, we explored the role of human macrophage transporters in the intracellular accumulation and antileishmanial activity of miltefosine (MLF), the only oral drug available for the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Membrane transporter gene expression in primary human macrophages infected in vitro with Leishmania Viannia panamensis and exposed to MLF showed modulation of ABC and solute liquid carrier transporters gene transcripts. Among these, ABCA3, a lipid transporter, was significantly induced after exposure to MLF, and this induction was confirmed in primary macrophages from CL patients. Functional validation of MLF as a substrate for ABCA3 was performed by shRNA gene knockdown (KD) in THP-1 monocytes. Intracellular accumulation of radiolabeled MLF was significantly higher in ABCA3(KD) macrophages. ABCA3(KD) resulted in increased cytotoxicity induced by MLF exposure. ABCA3 gene expression inversely correlated with intracellular MLF content in primary macrophages from CL patients. ABCA3(KD) reduced parasite survival during macrophage infection with an L. V. panamensis strain exhibiting low in vitro susceptibility to MLF. Confocal microscopy showed ABCA3 to be located in the cell membrane of resting macrophages and in intracellular compartments in L. V. panamensis-infected cells. These results provide evidence of ABCA3 as an MLF efflux transporter in human macrophages and support its role in the direct antileishmanial effect of this alkylphosphocholine drug.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Antimonials are the first drug of choice for the treatment of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL); however, their efficacy is not predictable, and this may be linked to parasite drug resistance. We aimed to characterize the in vitro antimony susceptibility of clinical isolates of Peruvian patients with ATL who were treated with sodium stibogluconate and to correlate this in vitro phenotype with different treatment outcomes.


METHODS

Thirty-seven clinical isolates were obtained from patients with known disease and treatment histories. These isolates were typed, and the susceptibility of intracellular amastigotes to pentavalent (SbV) and trivalent (SbIII) antimonials was determined.


RESULTS

We observed 29 SbV-resistant isolates among 4 species of subgenus Viannia, most of which exhibited primary resistance; isolates resistant only to SbIII; and 3 combinations of in vitro phenotypes: (1) parasites sensitive to both drugs, (2) parasites resistant to both drugs, and (3) parasites resistant to SbV only (the majority of isolates fell into this category). There was no correlation between in vitro susceptibility to both antimonials and the clinical outcome of therapy.


CONCLUSION

Antimony insensitivity might occur in a stepwise fashion (first to SbV and then to SbIII). Our data question the definition of true parasite resistance to antimonials. Further studies of treatment efficacy should apply standardized protocols and definitions and should also consider host factors.},

	abstract = {Schistosomiasis is an infectious parasitic disease caused by helminths from the genus Schistosoma; it affects over 200 million people globally and is endemic in 70 countries. In Brazil, 6 million individuals are infected with Schistosoma mansoni. Furthermore, as the prevalence of S. mansoni infections is increasing, approximately 26 million citizens in 19 Brazilian states are at risk for infection. Schistosomiasis disease control involves predominately the administration of a single drug, praziquantel. Although praziquantel exhibits chemotherapeutic efficacy and safety, its massive use in endemic zones, the possibility of the emergence of drug-resistant Schistosoma parasites, and the lack of another efficacious antischistosomal drug demand the discovery of new schistosomicidal compounds. First developed as anti-tumor drug, miltefosine is an alkylphospholipid derivative that exhibits bioactivity against Leishmania and Trypanosoma parasites, free-living protozoa, bacteria, and fungi. With its anti-parasite activity, miltefosine was the first orally administered drug against visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis approved. Previously, by means of the MTT cytotoxic assay and a DNA fragmentation test, we verified that, at doses of 100 and 200 μM (40 and 80 μg/mL), miltefosine exhibited in vitro schistosomicidal activity against adult S. mansoni worms. Here, we present ultrastructural evidence of rapid, severe miltefosine-induced surface membrane damage in S. mansoni following drug treatment. The number of dead parasites was concentration- and time-dependent following miltefosine treatment. At a miltefosine concentration of 200 μM (∼80 μg/mL), in vitro parasite killing was initiated as early as 3 h post-incubation, and it was maximal after 24 h of treatment. The parasite death was preceded by progressive surface membrane damage, characterized by tegument peeling, spine reduction and erosion, blister formation and rupture, and the emergence of holes. According to our present results, miltefosine is very effective at inducing membrane destruction of S. mansoni with a short onset of pharmacological action.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Miltefosine is the first oral drug with demonstrable success in treating visceral leishmaniasis in adults. Because approximately one-half of the visceral leishmaniasis patients worldwide are children, we performed a Phase I/II dose ranging study in the pediatric population in India.


METHODS

Thirty-nine (39) children (defined as {\textless} 12 years of age) with visceral leishmaniasis demonstrated by parasites in splenic aspirates, were treated with oral miltefosine daily for 28 days: 21 patients received 1.5 mg/kg/day (Group A); and 18 patients received 2.5 mg/kg/day (Group B). About one-half of these children had failed prior antileishmanial treatment.


RESULTS

All patients were parasitologically negative and symptomatically improved by the end of therapy on Day 28 of therapy; the initial parasitologic cure rate was 100\%. Two patients in each treatment group relapsed with fever, splenomegaly and parasite-positive splenic aspirates by the end of the 6-month follow-up. The per protocol final clinical cure rate was 19 of 21 = 90\% in Group A and 15 of 17 = 88\% in Group B. Miltefosine was well-tolerated. As per the adult experience, gastrointestinal adverse events were seen: 33 and 39\% of children experienced vomiting and 5 and 17\% experienced diarrhea in Groups A and B, respectively, but all episodes were mild to moderate in severity and commonly lasted {\textless}1 day without symptomatic treatment.


CONCLUSION

Oral miltefosine was safe and approximately 90\% effective in this initial clinical trial of childhood visceral leishmaniasis.},

Pharmacokinetics (PK) of imipenem-cilastatin (IMP/C) and MK7655 were determined for intraperitoneal doses of 4 mg/kg to 128 mg/kg of body weight. MIC and pharmacodynamics (PD) studies of MK7655 were performed against several beta-lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains to determine its effect in vitro and in vivo. Neutropenic mice were infected in each thigh 2 h before treatment with an inoculum of approximately 5×10(6) CFU. They were treated with IMP/C alone (every 2 hours [q2h], various doses) or in combination with MK7655 in either a dose fractionation study or q2h for 24 h and sacrificed for CFU determinations. IMP/MK7655 decreased MICs regarding IMP MIC. The PK profiles of IMP/C and MK7655 were linear over the dosing range studied and comparable with volumes of distribution (V) of 0.434 and 0.544 liter/kg and half-lives (t1/2) of 0.24 and 0.25 h, respectively. Protein binding of MK7655 was 20\%. A sigmoidal maximum effect (Emax) model was fit to the PK/PD index responses. The effect of the inhibitor was not related to the maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax)/MIC, and model fits for T{\textgreater}MIC and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)/MIC were comparable (R2 of 0.7 and 0.75), but there appeared to be no significant relationship of effect with dose frequency. Escalating doses of MK7655 and IMP/C showed that the AUC of MK7655 required for a static effect was dependent on the dose of IMP/C and the MIC of the strain, with a mean area under the concentration-time curve for the free, unbound fraction of the drug (fAUC) of 26.0 mg · h/liter. MK7655 shows significant activity in vivo and results in efficacy of IMP/C in otherwise resistant strains.

Caco-2 cell monolayers were used as a validated in vitro model of the intestinal barrier and Leishmania donovani promastigotes as a model for evaluating the effect of the drug combination. Spectroscopic measurements demonstrated that HePC and AMB associate, leading to the formation of mixed aggregates in which AMB is solubilized as monomers. The incubation of the association of HePC and AMB with Caco-2 cell monolayers, at a concentration higher than 5 μM, led to (i) a reduction of the HePC-induced paracellular permeability enhancement in Caco-2 cell monolayers, (ii) an inhibition of the uptake of both drugs, and (iii) a decrease in the transepithelial transport of both drugs, suggesting that a pharmacokinetic antagonism between HePC and AMB could occur after their oral administration. However, the combination did not exhibit any antagonism or synergy in its antileishmanial activity. These results demonstrated a strong physicochemical interaction between HePC and AMB, depending on the concentration of each, which could have important consequences for their biological activities, if they are administered together.},

To estimate the relative risk for peptic ulcer disease that is associated with the use of oral corticosteroids.


DESIGN

A nested case-control study.


SETTING

Tennessee Medicaid program.


PARTICIPANTS

The case patients (n = 1415) were hospitalized between 1984 and 1986 for gastric or duodenal ulcer or for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage of unknown cause. The controls (n = 7063) were randomly selected from Medicaid enrollees not meeting the study criteria for inclusion as case patients.


MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS

The estimated relative risk for the development of peptic ulcer disease among current users of oral corticosteroids was 2.0 (95\% CI, 1.3 to 3.0). However, the risk was increased only in those who concurrently received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); these persons had an estimated relative risk associated with current corticosteroid use of 4.4 (CI, 2.0 to 9.7). In contrast, the estimated relative risk for those corticosteroid users not receiving NSAIDs was 1.1 (CI, 0.5 to 2.1). Persons concurrently receiving corticosteroids and NSAIDs had a risk for peptic ulcer disease that was 15 times greater than that of nonusers of either drug.


CONCLUSION

Discrepant findings among earlier studies regarding steroids and the risk for peptic ulcer disease could in part be due to differences in the use of NSAIDs among study participants. The high risk for peptic ulcer disease associated with combined use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids indicates the need to prescribe this drug combination cautiously.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

This study was designed for comparative evaluation of two relatively newer recombinant hydrophilic antigens, rK9 and rK26 of Leishmania chagasi along with rK39 (a 39-aminoacid-repetitive immunodominant B-cell epitope of kinesin-related antigen from L. chagasi) and crude soluble antigen (CSA) for the serodiagnosis of Indian visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients by quantitative ELISA.


METHODOLOGY

In the present study a total of 80 subjects comprising of 55 confirmed VL cases and 25 endemic controls (EC) were subjected to ELISA using four different antigens, namely rK9, rK26, rK39 and CSA (derived from Leishmania donovani promastigotes).


RESULTS

Sensitivity was as follows: 78\% (95\%CI 63-100\%) for rK9, 38\% (95\%CI 28-59\%) for rK26, 100\% for rK39, and 80\% (95\% CI 65-100\%) for CSA. The specificity of rK9, rK26, rK39 and CSA was found to be 84\% (95\%CI 61-100\%), 80\% (95\%CI 56-100\%), 96\% (95\%CI 75-100\%) and 72\% (95\%CI 49-100\%), respectively.


CONCLUSIONS

rK39 was observed to be the most suitable antigen as compared to rK26 and rK9 whereas rK9 performed better than rK26. Hence rK9 antigen may either be used as an adjunct to rK39 for accurate diagnosis of VL or may be used in the absence or non-availability of rK39 antigen for the serodiagnosis.},

Distinct patterns of CD4+ cell cytokine expression were apparent: C57BL/6 CD4+ cells contained IFN-gamma and IL-2 mRNA, whereas BALB/c CD4+ cells expressed IL-4 and IL-10 message. CD8+ cells contributed little lymphokine expression during disease, but B cells were a major source of IL-2 mRNA in both strains of mice. BALB/c mice made resistant by treatment with anti-CD4 antibody at the time of infection repopulated lymph nodes with CD4+ cells that expressed IL-2 and IFN-gamma. Protective treatment with anti-IL-4 antibody in vivo also resulted in the appearance of CD4+ cells with increased IFN-gamma and diminished IL-4 and IL-10 expression.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Leishmania (Viannia) species are the principal cause of mucosal leishmaniasis. The natural history and pathogenesis of mucosal disease are enigmatic. Parasitological evaluation of mucosal tissues has been constrained by the invasiveness of conventional sampling methods.


METHODS

We evaluated the presence of Leishmania in the mucosa of 26 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis and 2 patients with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Swab samples of the nasal mucosa, tonsils, and conjunctiva were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction with LV-B1 primers and Southern blot hybridization.


RESULTS

Two patients with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis and 21 (81\%) of 26 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis had Leishmania kinetoplast minicircle DNA (kDNA) in mucosal tissues. kDNA was amplified from swab samples of nasal mucosa from 14 (58\%) of 24 patients, tonsils from 13 (46\%) of 28 patients, and conjunctiva from 6 (25\%) of 24 patients. kDNA was detected in the mucosa of patients with cutaneous disease caused by Leishmania panamensis, Leishmania guyanensis, and Leishmania braziliensis.


CONCLUSION

The asymptomatic presence of parasites in mucosal tissues may be common in patients with Leishmania (Viannia) infection.},

Miltefosine has great potential for improving access to treatment and overall control of VL and will be critical in the VL elimination campaign in the Indian subcontinent, but must be safeguarded or will be lost if misused. Its main limitations are adherence (and hence potential for selection of drug resistant parasites) and teratogenicity (pregnancy must be avoided during treatment and the following two months). This calls for responsible deployment, setting in place mechanisms to protect female patients in child-bearing age, monitoring effects and optimizing adherence in real-life conditions through directly observed therapy.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

There are 500,000 cases per year of visceral leishmaniasis, which occurs primarily in the Indian subcontinent. Almost all untreated patients die, and all the effective agents have been parenteral. Miltefosine is an oral agent that has been shown in small numbers of patients to have a favorable therapeutic index for Indian visceral leishmaniasis. We performed a clinical trial in India comparing miltefosine with the most effective standard treatment, amphotericin B.


METHODS

The study was a randomized, open-label comparison, in which 299 patients 12 years of age or older received orally administered miltefosine (50 or 100 mg [approximately 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight] daily for 28 days) and 99 patients received intravenously administered amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram every other day for a total of 15 injections).


RESULTS

The groups were well matched in terms of age, weight, proportion with previous failure of treatment for leishmaniasis, parasitologic grade of splenic aspirate, and splenomegaly. At the end of treatment, splenic aspirates were obtained from 293 patients in the miltefosine group and 98 patients in the amphotericin B group. No parasites were identified, for an initial cure rate of 100 percent. By six months after the completion of treatment, 282 of the 299 patients in the miltefosine group (94 percent [95 percent confidence interval, 91 to 97]) and 96 of the 99 patients in the amphotericin B group (97 percent) had not had a relapse; these patients were classified as cured. Vomiting and diarrhea, generally lasting one to two days, occurred in 38 percent and 20 percent of the patients in the miltefosine group, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS

Oral miltefosine is an effective and safe treatment for Indian visceral leishmaniasis. Miltefosine may be particularly advantageous because it can be administered orally. It may also be helpful in regions where parasites are resistant to current agents.},

Sixty patients, 30 children aged 2 to 12 years and 30 adults aged 18 to 60 years, were enrolled. Participants received miltefosine (Impavido) at a nominal dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days. Miltefosine concentrations were measured in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of samples obtained during treatment and up to 6 months following completion of treatment, when therapeutic outcome was determined. Fifty-two patients were cured, 5 pediatric patients failed treatment, and 3 participants were lost to follow-up. Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis predominated among the strains isolated (42/46; 91\%). Noncompartmental analysis demonstrated that plasma and intracellular miltefosine concentrations were, overall, lower in children than in adults. Exposure to miltefosine, estimated by area under the concentration-time curve and maximum concentration, was significantly lower in children in both the central and intracellular compartments (P {\textless} 0.01). Leishmania persistence was detected in 43\% of study participants at the end of treatment and in 27\% at 90 days after initiation of treatment. Clinical response was not dependent on parasite elimination. In vitro miltefosine susceptibility was similar for Leishmania strains from adults and children. Our results document PK differences for miltefosine in children and adults with cutaneous leishmaniasis that affect drug exposure and could influence the outcome of treatment, and they provide bases for optimizing therapeutic regimens for CL in pediatric populations.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the incidence of peptic ulcer in patients who use systemic corticosteroids and of the underlying mechanism of action, in order to determine whether there is a need for gastric protection using proton pump inhibitors in these patients.
DESIGN: Systematic literature review of published meta-analyses and case-control studies, supported by relevant literature on the effects of corticosteroids in relation to the development of ulcers.
METHOD: Analysis of literature was performed using the PubMed database with the search terms 'adrenal cortex hormones', 'peptic ulcer' and their synonyms. Meta-analyses and case-control studies with more than 1000 patients were included.
RESULTS: The literature search resulted in 970 articles, of which 3 were classified as relevant meta-analyses and 3 as relevant case-control studies. All meta-analyses indicated that peptic ulcer is, at the most, a rare complication of systemic corticosteroid therapy occurring in less than 0.4-1.8\% of patients. As the incidence is low, there is no indication for routine prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors in combination with systemic corticosteroids. There is convincing evidence showing an increased risk of ulcers and a poorer recovery from these when NSAIDs and systemic corticosteroids are used concomitantly; this is a combination for which a proton pump inhibitor should be prescribed.
CONCLUSION: Systemic corticosteroid therapy only rarely causes a peptic ulcer. Routine prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors is therefore not indicated for short-term systemic corticosteroid use.},

The molecular mechanisms that contribute to the antileishmanial activity of HePC are still unknown. We report that in wild-type promastigotes of Leishmania donovani HePC is able to induce a cell death process with numerous cytoplasmic, nuclear, and membrane features of metazoan apoptosis, including cell shrinkage, DNA fragmentation into oligonucleosome-sized fragments, and phosphatidylserine exposure. None of these changes were detected in an HePC-resistant clone treated with the same drug concentration. Therefore, HePC does not appear to kill L. donovani promastigotes by a direct toxic mechanism but, rather, kills the promastigotes by an indirect one. Pretreatment of wild-type promastigotes with two broad caspase inhibitors, z-Val-Ala-dl-Asp(methoxy)-fluoromethylketone and Boc-Asp(methoxy)-fluoromethylketone, as well as a broad protease inhibitor, calpain inhibitor I, prior to drug exposure interfered with DNA fragmentation but did not prevent cell shrinkage or phosphatidylserine externalization. These data suggest that at least part of the apoptotic machinery operating in wild-type promastigotes involves proteases. Identification of the death-signaling pathways activated in HePC-sensitive parasites appears to be essential for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action and resistance in these parasites.},

Due to increasing unresponsiveness to this drug in the current epidemic that began in the early 1970s, daily doses of 20 mg/kg/day for 30 days or more is recommended as opposed to the 10 mg/kg/day dose for 6-10 days used in the past. Of the 130-150 patients treated annually at our center with locally made sodium antimony gluconate, serious cardiotoxicity has occurred in less than 10\%. During April 1995 at the University Hospital in Varanasi, we encountered life-threatening cardiotoxicity after 3-28 days of therapy in each of the eight patients being treated with a new lot of this drug made by a different manufacturer. Of the eight patients, six each developed congestive heart failure and/or prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc), and three died as a direct consequence of drug-induced toxicities. In three instances, the life-threatening complications occurred with a cumulative dose of less than 300 mg/kg. In patients with prolonged QTc, ventricular premature beats and ventricular tachycardia were recorded; in one patient, the ventricular tachycardia progressed to torsade de pointes, culminating in ventricular fibrillation and death. Since switching to different lots of this drug, we have not seen further clustering of dangerous cardiotoxicity. The antimony content of the implicated drug was comparable with that in lots from other manufacturers that did not show overt toxicity, but the osmolarity was approximately 300 mOsm/L higher. The simple technique of measuring of osmolarity may help identify inappropriately manufactured drug.},

We aim to provide a comprehensive description of available data sources, propose a set of indicators for monitoring the global landscape of health R\&D, and present a sample of country indicators on research inputs (investments), processes (clinical trials), and outputs (publications), based on data from international databases. Total global investments in health R\&D (both public and private sector) in 2009 reached US\$240 billion. Of the US\$214 billion invested in high-income countries, 60\% of health R\&D investments came from the business sector, 30\% from the public sector, and about 10\% from other sources (including private non-profit organisations). Only about 1\% of all health R\&D investments were allocated to neglected diseases in 2010. Diseases of relevance to high-income countries were investigated in clinical trials seven-to-eight-times more often than were diseases whose burden lies mainly in low-income and middle-income countries. This report confirms that substantial gaps in the global landscape of health R\&D remain, especially for and in low-income and middle-income countries. Too few investments are targeted towards the health needs of these countries. Better data are needed to improve priority setting and coordination for health R\&D, ultimately to ensure that resources are allocated to diseases and regions where they are needed the most. The establishment of a global observatory on health R\&D, which is being discussed at WHO, could address the absence of a comprehensive and sustainable mechanism for regular global monitoring of health R\&D.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the transport mechanism for the removal of miltefosine and [99mTc]-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) from multidrug-resistant cells. The P-glycoprotein pump function, cell viability, and 99mTc-MIBI and 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (18FDG) uptakes were measured in NIH 3T3 (3T3) and NIH 3T3MDR1 G185 (3T3MDR1) mouse fibroblasts and human lymphoid B JY cells. Miltefosine treatment increased the permeability and fluidity of these tumor cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The multidrug-sensitive cells were 3–4 times more sensitive to miltefosine than the multidrug-resistant ones. The extent of 99mTc-MIBI accumulation in the P-glycoprotein-expressing cells increased in the presence of miltefosine, whereas the rhodamine123 and daunorubicin uptakes of the cells did not change significantly. In the 3T3MDR1 cells verapamil reinstated the rhodamine123 and daunorubicin accumulation, but not the 99mTc-MIBI uptake. Cyclosporin A reinstated the uptakes of 99mTc-MIBI, daunorubicin and rhodamine123 by the 3T3MDR1 cells. In a concentration-dependent manner miltefosine decreased the extents of 99mTc-MIBI, rhodamine123, daunorubicin and 18FDG accumulation in the JY and 3T3 cells. Our findings indicate a common transport mechanism for 99mTc-MIBI and miltefosine, which is distinct from that for rhodamine123 and daunorubicin in MDR cells.},

Amastin is a surface glycoprotein abundantly expressed on the intracellular mammalian amastigote form of the protozoan parasite, and tuzin is a G-like protein. We demonstrated previously that the amastin-tuzin gene cluster is polycistronically transcribed to an equal extent in all parasite life cycle stages. The steady state level of amastin mRNA, however, is 68-fold more abundant in amastigotes than in epimastigotes. Here we show that the half-life of amastin mRNA is 7 times longer in amastigotes than in epimastigotes. Linker replacement experiments demonstrate that the middle one-third of the 630-nucleotide 3'-untranslated region (UTR) is responsible for the amastin mRNA up-regulation. This positive effect is dependent on the distance of the 3'-UTR segment from the stop codon and the polyadenylation site as well as on its orientation. A protein or protein complex more abundant in amastigotes than in epimastigotes binds to this minimally defined 3'-UTR segment and may be involved in its regulatory function.},

	doi = {10.1186/1475-2875-8-253},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preventing the emergence of anti-malarial drug resistance is critical for the success of current malaria elimination efforts. Prevention strategies have focused predominantly on qualitative factors, such as choice of drugs, use of combinations and deployment of multiple first-line treatments. The importance of anti-malarial treatment dosing has been underappreciated. Treatment recommendations are often for the lowest doses that produce "satisfactory" results.
METHODS: The probability of de-novo resistant malaria parasites surviving and transmitting depends on the relationship between their degree of resistance and the blood concentration profiles of the anti-malarial drug to which they are exposed. The conditions required for the in-vivo selection of de-novo emergent resistant malaria parasites were examined and relative probabilities assessed.
RESULTS: Recrudescence is essential for the transmission of de-novo resistance. For rapidly eliminated anti-malarials high-grade resistance can arise from a single drug exposure, but low-grade resistance can arise only from repeated inadequate treatments. Resistance to artemisinins is, therefore, unlikely to emerge with single drug exposures. Hyperparasitaemic patients are an important source of de-novo anti-malarial drug resistance. Their parasite populations are larger, their control of the infection insufficient, and their rates of recrudescence following anti-malarial treatment are high. As use of substandard drugs, poor adherence, unusual pharmacokinetics, and inadequate immune responses are host characteristics, likely to pertain to each recurrence of infection, a small subgroup of patients provides the particular circumstances conducive to de-novo resistance selection and transmission.
CONCLUSION: Current dosing recommendations provide a resistance selection opportunity in those patients with low drug levels and high parasite burdens (often children or pregnant women). Patients with hyperparasitaemia who receive outpatient treatments provide the greatest risk of selecting de-novo resistant parasites. This emphasizes the importance of ensuring that only quality-assured anti-malarial combinations are used, that treatment doses are optimized on the basis of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic assessments in the target populations, and that patients with heavy parasite burdens are identified and receive sufficient treatment to prevent recrudescence.},

The compounds were given orally at a daily dose of 75 mumol/kg body weight. After 6, 11, and 18 days, three rats in each treatment group were killed and the drug concentration in various tissues and fluids was determined. With the exception of the kidney (He-PC) and brain (He-PC and ET18-OCH3), steady-state levels of the drugs could be achieved in all organs investigated and in serum. Maximal concentrations of He-PC were found in the kidney, adrenal glands, and spleen, whereas the highest concentrations of ET18-OCH3 were detected in the adrenal glands, spleen, and small intestine. The concentrations of He-PC exceeded those of ET18-OCH3 in most tissues by a factor of about 2-25. Since samples of urine and feces did not contain detectable amounts of the compounds, the absorption of both lipid analogues was assumed to be complete. The total amount of He-PC recovered after 6, 11, and 18 days was 15\%, 12\%, and 6\%, respectively, and that of ET18-OCH3 was 1.3\%, 0.8\%, and 0.3\%, respectively. This indicates that the bioavailability of He-PC and ET18-OCH3 is not controlled by differences in the uptake of the two drugs, but by differences in their metabolism.

	abstract = {The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in leishmaniasis patients are, to a great extent, unknown. We examined and characterized the pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in a group of patients with Old World (Leishmania major) cutaneous leishmaniasis. Miltefosine plasma concentrations were determined in samples taken during and up to 5 months after the end of treatment from 31 Dutch military personnel who contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and were treated with 150 mg miltefosine/day for 28 days. Samples were analyzed with a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 4 ng/ml. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed with nonlinear mixed-effect modeling, using NONMEM. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine could best be described by an open two-compartment disposition model, with a first elimination half-life of 7.05 days and a terminal elimination half-life of 30.9 days. The median concentration in the last week of treatment (days 22 to 28) was 30,800 ng/ml. The maximum duration of follow-up was 202 days after the start of treatment. All analyzed samples contained a concentration above the LLOQ. Miltefosine is eliminated from the body much slower than previously thought and is therefore still detectable in human plasma samples taken 5 to 6 months after the end of treatment. The presence of subtherapeutic miltefosine concentrations in the blood beyond 5 months after treatment might contribute to the selection of resistant parasites, and moreover, the measures for preventing the teratogenic risks of miltefosine treatment should be reconsidered.},

	abstract = {In a pilot trial, 28 days of oral treatment with 100-200 mg miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine) per day cured 14 of 15 patients with Indian visceral leishmaniasis (VL). To extend the testing of this regimen, 45 additional subjects with VL, of whom 17 had failed previous antimony therapy, were treated with 100 (N = 17), 150 (N = 18) or 200 (N = 10) mg/day. Enrollment at 200 mg/day was stopped after three subjects in this treatment arm developed reversible but serious (grade-3) adverse reactions. The overall clinical and parasitological responses to miltefosine were rapid, with 40 [89\%; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 76\%-96\%] and 44 (98\%; CI = 88\%-100\%) of the patients apparently cured on days 14 and 28, respectively. The one 'treatment failure' recorded on day 28 (and at 6 months) was a subject lost to follow-up. Those apparently cured by day 28 included six patients (one on 100 mg, two on 150 mg and three on 200 mg/day) removed from treatment on days 7-17 because of grade-3 diarrhoea (two cases), vomiting (two cases), diarrhoea and hepatotoxicity (one case) or nephrotoxicity (one case). Transient, mild-moderate vomiting and/or diarrhoea were common during weeks 1-2 and about 25\% of the patients also developed primarily mild, self-limited increases in concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase and creatinine and/or blood urea nitrogen. At a 6-month follow-up, all 44 patients apparently cured at day 28 were considered complete responders (definitive cures), including the six treated for only 7-17 days. These results indicate that 100 mg miltefosine/day for 28 days is a promising oral-treatment regimen for VL cases, including those with antimony-unresponsive infections.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the activity of NAI-107 against S. aureus strains, including MRSA, in the neutropenic murine thigh infection model. Serum pharmacokinetics were determined and time-kill studies were performed following administration of single subcutaneous doses of 5, 20, and 80 mg/kg body weight. The dose fractionation included total doses ranging from 1.56 to 400 mg/kg/72 h, divided into 1, 2, 3, or 6 doses. Studies of treatment effects against 9 S. aureus strains (4 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus [MSSA] and 5 MRSA) using a 12-h dosing interval and total dose range of 1.56 to 400 mg/kg/72 h were also performed. A maximum effect (Emax) model was used to determine the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index that best described the dose-response data and to estimate the doses required to achieve a net bacteriostatic dose (SD) and a 1-log reduction in CFU/thigh. The pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) range of 26.8 to 276 mg·h/liter and half-lives of 4.2 to 8.2 h. MICs ranged from 0.125 to 0.5 μg/ml. The 2 highest single doses produced more than a 2-log kill and prolonged postantibiotic effects (PAEs) ranging from 36 to {\textgreater}72 h. The dose fractionation-response curves were similar, and the AUC/MIC ratio was the most predictive PD index (AUC/MIC, coefficient of determination [R2]=0.89; maximum concentration of drug in serum [Cmax]/MIC, R2=0.79; time [T]{\textgreater}MIC, R2=0.63). A ≥2-log kill was observed against all 9 S. aureus strains. The total drug 24-h AUC/MIC values associated with stasis and a 1-log kill for the 9 S. aureus strains were 371±130 and 510±227, respectively. NAI-107 demonstrated concentration-dependent killing and prolonged PAEs. The AUC/MIC ratio was the predictive PD index. Extensive killing was observed for S. aureus organisms, independent of the MRSA status. The AUC/MIC target should be useful for the design of clinical dosing regimens.},

Because of instability in eastern Afghanistan, new refugees crossed into the federally administered tribal areas of northwestern Pakistan in 2002. In 2003, we investigated an epidemic of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in 1 of the camps. Incidence was 100.4 cases/1,000 person-years; in other nearby camps it was only 2.1/1,000 person-years. Anopheline mosquitoes were found despite an earlier spray campaign. Documented clinical failures at the basic health unit prompted a drug resistance survey of locally manufactured sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine used for routine treatment. The in vivo failure rate was 28.5\%. PCR analysis of the P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase and dihyropteroate synthase genes showed no mutations associated with clinical failure. However, chemical analysis of the drug showed that it was substandard. As global incidence decreases and epidemics become more of a threat, enhanced quality assurance of control interventions is essential.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to estimate the population pharmacokinetics of voriconazole, to identify the factors influencing voriconazole pharmacokinetics and to identify optimal dosage regimens for attaining target pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic indices against Aspergillus and Candida infections in patients with invasive fungal infections (IFIs).
METHODS: To prospectively quantify the relationships between the pharmacokinetic parameters of voriconazole and covariates, a population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted on pooled data from 406 samples taken from 151 patients with IFIs. Voriconazole plasma concentrations were measured by HPLC. The following covariates were tested: demographic factors, laboratory data, concomitant medications and CYP2C19 genotype. Monte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the currently recommended dosage regimen and to design an optimized pharmacodynamic dosage strategy for voriconazole.
RESULTS: The data were appropriately fit by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. The voriconazole clearance (CL) was 6.95 L/h, the volume of distribution (V) was 200 L and the oral bioavailability (F) was 89.5\%. CL was significantly associated with age, the serum concentration of alkaline phosphatase and the CYP2C19 genotype. Based on the results of the Monte Carlo stimulation, we concluded that Aspergillus infections could be treated effectively with 200 mg of voriconazole administered intravenously or orally twice daily and that Candida infections could be treated with 300 mg administered orally twice daily or with 200 mg administered intravenously twice daily.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that optimal voriconazole dosage regimens could be determined successfully with prospective population pharmacokinetic analyses and Monte Carlo simulations.},

	abstract = {Deformable vesicles and traditional liposomes were compared as delivery systems for oestradiol to elucidate possible mechanisms of drug delivery through human skin. Accordingly, epidermal permeation of oestradiol from optimized deformable vesicles and traditional liposome formulations was studied under low dose non-occluded conditions. Five mechanisms were investigated. A free drug mechanism compared low-dose permeation through skin with drug release determined after separation of the free drug. Penetration enhancement was researched by studying skin pretreatment with empty vesicles. Improved drug uptake by skin was monitored by dipping stratum corneum into different formulations for 10 min and determining drug uptake. The possibility that intact vesicles permeate through the epidermis was tested by comparing permeation from 136-nm vesicles with that from {\textgreater}500-nm vesicles, assuming that penetration depends on vesicle size. The possibility that different entrapment efficiencies in alternative formulations could be responsible for the difference in delivery was also evaluated. Lipid vesicles improved the skin delivery of oestradiol compared with delivery from an aqueous control. Maximum flux (Jmax) was increased 14- to 17-fold by use of deformable vesicles and 8.2- to 9.8-fold by use of traditional liposomes. Deformable vesicles were thus superior to traditional liposomes. Drug release was negligible over the period during which skin flux was maximum. Pretreatment with empty vesicles resulted in an enhancement ratio of 4.3 for pure phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles but the enhancement ratio ranged from only 0.8 to 2.4 for other formulations. Vesicles increased drug uptake into the stratum corneum 23- to 29-fold. Relative flux values obtained from small and large vesicles were similar. No correlation was found between entrapment efficiency and skin delivery. The results showed no evidence of a free drug mechanism, but revealed a possible penetration-enhancing effect for pure PC vesicles, although this was not the only mechanism operating. The positive uptake suggested that lipid vesicles increased drug partitioning into the skin. The data provided no evidence for in-vitro liposome penetration through skin as distinct from vesicle penetration into the stratum corneum.},

	abstract = {Invasive fungal disease (IFD) remains life threatening in premature infants and immunocompromised children despite the recent development of new antifungal agents. Optimal dosing of antifungals is one of the few factors clinicians can control to improve outcomes of IFD. However, dosing in children cannot be extrapolated from adult data because IFD pathophysiology, immune response, and drug disposition differ from adults. We critically examined the literature on pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of antifungal agents and highlight recent developments in treating pediatric IFD. To match adult exposure in pediatric patients, dosing adjustment is necessary for almost all antifungals. In young infants, the maturation of renal and metabolic functions occurs rapidly and can significantly influence drug exposure. Fluconazole clearance doubles from birth to 28 days of life and, beyond the neonatal period, agents such as fluconazole, voriconazole, and micafungin require higher dosing than in adults because of faster clearance in children. As a result, dosing recommendations are specific to bracketed ranges of age. PD principles of antifungals mostly rely on in vitro and in vivo models but very few PD studies specifically address IFD in children. The exposure-response relationship may differ in younger children compared with adults, especially in infants with invasive candidiasis who are at higher risk of disseminated disease and meningoencephalitis, and by extension severe neurodevelopmental impairment. Micafungin is the only antifungal agent for which a specific target of exposure was proposed based on a neonatal hematogenous Candida meningoencephalitis animal model. In this review, we found that pediatric data on drug disposition of newer triazoles and echinocandins are lacking, dosing of older antifungals such as fluconazole and amphotericin B products still need optimization in young infants, and that target PK/PD indices need to be clinically validated for almost all antifungals in children. A better understanding of age-specific PK and PD of new antifungals in infants and children will help improve clinical outcomes of IFD by informing dosing and identifying future research areas.},

With Indian strains and isolates of L. donovani the assay was sensitive enough to detect kDNA in an amount equivalent to a single parasite or less. The extreme sensitivity of the assay was reflected in its ability to detect parasite DNA from small volumes of peripheral blood of patients with kala-azar (KA) and from skin lesions from patients with post-KA dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). A total of 107 clinical leishmaniasis samples were analyzed. Of these 102 (95.3\%) were positive by PCR. The test provided a diagnosis of KA with 96\% sensitivity using patient whole-blood samples instead of bone marrow or spleen aspirates that are obtained by invasive procedures. The assay was also successful in the diagnosis of 45 of 48 PKDL cases (93.8\%). Cross-reactions with pathogens prevalent in the area of endemicity, viz., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, and Plasmodium spp., could be ruled out. Eighty-one control samples, including dermal scrapings from healthy portions of skin from patients with PKDL were all negative. Two of twenty controls from the area of endemicity were found positive by PCR assay; however, there was a good possibility that these two were asymptomatic carriers since they were serologically positive for KA. Thus, this PCR assay represents a tool for the diagnosis of KA and PKDL in Indian patients in a noninvasive manner, with simultaneous species identification of parasites in clinical samples.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Use of miltefosine in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is hampered by its potential teratogenicity. The duration of adequate contraceptive cover in females of child-bearing potential after cessation of a potentially teratogenic drug therapy remains debated. The objective of this study was to provide a rational approach to suggest durations of contraceptive cover for various miltefosine regimens.
METHODS: A human reproductive safety threshold exposure limit was derived using animal-to-human dose conversion. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data for miltefosine in females are lacking; a previously developed population PK model and a comprehensive anthropometric dataset were used to simulate PK data for Indian female VL patients receiving miltefosine for 5, 7, 10 or 28 days. Probability of supra-threshold miltefosine exposure was used to evaluate adequate durations of post-treatment contraceptive cover for the various regimens.
RESULTS: PK data were simulated for 465 treated Indian female VL patients of child-bearing potential with a median age of 25 years (IQR 16-31 years) and median weight of 38 kg (IQR 34-42 kg). From animal reproductive toxicity studies, a human reproductive safety threshold exposure limit was derived of 24.5 μg · day/mL. Probability of 'unprotected' supra-threshold miltefosine exposure was very low ({\textless}0.2\%) for a post-treatment contraceptive cover period of 4 months for the standard 28 day regimen, and of 2 months for the shorter regimens.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study providing rational suggestions for contraceptive cover for a teratogenic drug based on animal-to-human dose conversion. For the 28 day miltefosine regimen, post-treatment contraceptive cover may be extended to 4 months, whereas for all shorter regimens 2 months may be adequate.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE

Preterm and term newborn infants show wide interindividual variability (IIV) in pharmacokinetic parameters of gentamicin. More extensive knowledge and use of predictive covariates could lead to faster attainment of therapeutic concentrations and a reduced need for concentration monitoring. This study was performed to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of gentamicin in preterm and term neonates and to identify and quantify relationships between patient characteristics and IIV. A secondary aim was to evaluate cystatin C as a marker for gentamicin clearance in this patient population.


METHODS

Data were collected in a prospective study performed in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the University Children's Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. Population pharmacokinetic modelling was performed using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling (NONMEM) software. Bodyweight was included as the primary covariate according to an allometric power model. Other evaluated covariates were age (postmenstrual age, gestational age [GA], postnatal age [PNA]), markers for renal function (serum creatinine, serum cystatin C) and concomitant medication with cefuroxime, vancomycin or indometacin. Covariate-parameter relationships were explored using a stepwise covariate model building procedure. The predictive performance of the developed model was evaluated using an independent external dataset for a similar patient population.


RESULTS

Sixty-one newborn infants (GA range 23.3-42.1 weeks, PNA range 0-45 days) were enrolled in the study. In total, 894 serum gentamicin samples were included in the analysis. The concentration-time profile was described using a three-compartment model. Gentamicin clearance increased with the GA and PNA (included in a nonlinear fashion). The GA was also identified as having a significant influence on the central volume of distribution, with a preterm neonate having a larger central volume of distribution per kilogram of bodyweight than a term neonate. Cystatin C and creatinine were not correlated with gentamicin clearance in this study population. The external dataset was well predicted by the developed model.


CONCLUSION

Bodyweight and age (GA and PNA) were found to be major factors contributing to IIV in gentamicin clearance in neonates. Based on these data, cystatin C and serum creatinine were not correlated with gentamicin clearance and therefore not likely to be predictive markers of renal function in this patient population. Based on predictions from the developed model, preterm neonates do not reach targeted peak and trough gentamicin concentrations after a standard dosage regimen of 4 mg/kg given once daily, suggesting a need for higher loading doses and prolonged dosing intervals in this patient population.},

Prognostic elevation of CCL18 in blood of Gaucher patients has been confirmed by ELISA. Given its low molecular mass, positive charge, and relatively high abundance, CCL18 seems a particular attractive protein for SELDI-TOF based quantitation. Therefore, we determined CCL18 levels in plasma using SELDI-TOF MS and ELISA, in parallel. CCL18 levels in some blood samples were significantly underestimated when determined by SELDI-TOF MS. Spiking of recombinant CCL18 indicated that its detection by SELDI-TOF MS is strongly determined by the nature of the sample, even markedly varying between samples obtained from one donor at different time points. Independent of the total CCL18 concentration in blood only 1-10\% of the chemokine bound to the ProteinChip Array. Even when comparable amounts of CCL18 from distinct samples were bound to the ProteinChip Array, diverse peak intensities could be observed. Thus, limited binding capacity and sample-dependent suppression of CCL18 ionization contribute significantly to the final peak intensity. In conclusion, SELDI-TOF MS offers no reliable procedure to quantitatively monitor CCL18 levels in blood and thus cannot be applied in evaluation of disease status of Gaucher patients.},

Donors should encourage their partners to include more explicit quality requirements in their tender mechanisms, while purchasers should insist that producers and distributors supply drugs that comply with international quality standards.

We aimed to characterize the in vitro antimony susceptibility of clinical isolates of Nepalese VL patients, and to correlate this in vitro parasite phenotype to clinical therapy outcome. Thirty-three clinical isolates of L. donovani were taken from patients with known disease history. These isolates were typed and the susceptibility of intracellular amastigotes to pentavalent (SbV) and trivalent (SbIII) antimonials was determined. We observed (i) 22 SbV-resistant isolates out of 33 tested and (ii) 3 SbIII-resistant isolates out of 12 tested. Amongst the latter, there were three combinations of in vitro phenotypes: (i) parasites sensitive (n=4) or (ii) resistant to both drugs (n=3) and (iii) resistant to SbV only (n=5). There was no geographical clustering in terms of in vitro susceptibility. The relation between the in vitro susceptibility to antimonials and the corresponding in vivo treatment outcome was ambiguous. Our results highlight the need to adjust the currently used Leishmania drug susceptibility assays if they are to be used for prognosis of in vivo SSG treatment outcome.},

	abstract = {Governed by parasite and host factors and immunoinflammatory responses, the clinical spectrum of leishmaniasis encompasses subclinical (inapparent), localised (skin lesions), and disseminated infection (cutaneous, mucosal, or visceral). Symptomatic disease is subacute or chronic and diverse in presentation and outcome. Clinical characteristics vary further by endemic region. Despite T-cell-dependent immune responses, which produce asymptomatic and self-healing infection, or appropriate treatment, intracellular infection is probably life-long since targeted cells (tissue macrophages) allow residual parasites to persist. There is an epidemic of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and Pakistan and of visceral infection in India and Sudan. Diagnosis relies on visualising parasites in tissue or serology; culture and detection of parasite DNA are useful in the laboratory. Pentavalent antimony is the conventional treatment; however, resistance of visceral infection in India has spawned new treatment approaches--amphotericin B and its lipid formulations, injectable paromomycin, and oral miltefosine. Despite tangible advances in diagnosis, treatment, and basic scientific research, leishmaniasis is embedded in poverty and neglected. Current obstacles to realistic prevention and proper management include inadequate vector (sandfly) control, no vaccine, and insufficient access to or impetus for developing affordable new drugs.},

The fAUC0-24h and fAUC0-24h/MIC90 ratio, a PK/PD index predictive of bacterial eradication, were extracted from previously described population PK models for LFX and MOX. The MIC90 was according to EUCAST. Monte Carlo simulations were used with LFX 500 mg every 24h (q24 h) or every 12h (q12h), LFX 750 mg q24 h and MOX 400mg q24 h in non-compliance scenarios to derive the proportion of patients achieving target ratios of fAUC0-24h/MIC90{\textgreater}33.8 for Streptococcus pneumoniae and {\textgreater}100 for Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (PTA{\textgreater}90\%). In non-adherent dosing scenarios, LFX 500 mg q24 h was not able to reach the PK/PD index guaranteeing clinical efficacy. With LFX 500 mg q12 h or 750 mg q24 h, this probability was maintained although patients can take the dose with delays of up to 12h and 11h, respectively, for the three bacterial types. With MOX 400mg q24 h, the probability of achieving this PK/PD index is maintained with delay in dosing up to 16h. In conclusion, LFX 500 mg q24 h is the least robust treatment against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis in a non-adherence situation. A good choice is LFX 500 mg q12h, but in order to favour patient adherence, LFX 750 mg q24 h or MOX 400mg q24h appears as more appropriate.},

A review is made of the importance of the appropriateness of the dose regimen selected, the application of PK/PD analysis of antimicrobials, the Monte Carlo simulation, PK/PD indices for efficacy, and PK/PD cut-off points. PK/PD analysis is also applicable to the prevention of bacterial resistance. Different methods have been used to study the factors that lead to its emergence and spread, such as in vitro and animal models, and resistance prevention studies (mutant selection window).

The lack of a reliable methodology to quantify edelfosine is a major problem in ongoing and scheduled preclinical and clinical trials with this drug. We evaluated the applicability of high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine edelfosine in biological samples and polymeric delivery systems. Sample pre-treatment involved polymer precipitation or cell lysis with methanol. HPLC separation was performed on an Alltima RPC(18) narrow-bore column and edelfosine quantification was done by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) using positive ion mode and selected ion monitoring. Assays were linear in the tested range of 0.3-10 microg/ml. The limit of quantification was 0.3 ng/sample in both matrices, namely biological samples and polymeric delivery systems. The interassay precision ranging from 0.79 to 1.49\%, with relative errors of -6.7 and 12.8\%. Mean extraction recovery was 95.6\%. HPLC-ESI-MS is a reliable system for edelfosine analysis and quantification in samples from different sources, combining advantages of full automation (rapidity, ease of use, no need of extensive extraction procedures) with high analytical performance and throughput.},

Donors should encourage their partners to include more explicit quality requirements in their tender mechanisms, while purchasers should insist that producers and distributors supply drugs that comply with international quality standards.

Leishmania DNA was detected in 10 of 25 patients with microscopically confirmed visceral leishmaniasis and in none of those without this disease. Following treatment with liposomal amphotericin B, a clinical response was observed in 9 of 10 patients, in association with significantly decreased parasite loads. Seven patients relapsed clinically a median of 110 days after the end of treatment, in association with substantial increases in Leishmania DNA levels. Leishmania DNA levels correlated with the clinical course of visceral leishmaniasis, and their measurement at diagnosis and during and after treatment seems to be useful in the clinical management of HIV-infected patients with this disease.},

However, the use and application of molecular assays are increasing, but comparative studies on the performance of these different assays are lacking. The aim of this study was to compare three molecular assays for detection and quantification of Leishmania parasites in serial dilutions of parasites and in skin biopsies collected from cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) patients in Manaus, Brazil. A serial dilution of promastigotes spiked in blood was tested in triplicate in three different runs by quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA), quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). In addition, the costs, durations, and numbers of handling steps were compared, and 84 skin biopsies from patients with suspected CL were tested. Both QT-NASBA and qRT-PCR had a detection limit of 100 parasites/ml of blood, while qPCR detected 1,000 parasites/ml. QT-NASBA had the lowest range of intra-assay variation (coefficients of variation [CV], 0.5\% to 3.3\%), while qPCR had the lowest range of interassay variation (CV, 0.4\% to 5.3\%). Furthermore, qRT-PCR had higher r2 values and amplification efficiencies than qPCR, and qPCR and qRT-PCR had faster procedures than QT-NASBA. All assays performed equally well with patient samples, with significant correlations between parasite counts. Overall, qRT-PCR is preferred over QT-NASBA and qPCR as the most optimal diagnostic assay for quantification of Leishmania parasites, since it was highly sensitive and reproducible and the procedure was relatively fast.},

DAT antigen production was duly increased to allow coverage of a study population of 17826 inhabitants, 9619 of whom resided in Trishal, 7328 in Shahjadpur and 879 in Teknaf (Cox's Bazar), a known Leishmania-free district in Bangladesh. Despite large-scale production in batches of 1120-4000 ml (each sufficient for 1176-6400 screening doses), all DAT antigen batches performed as required in quality control tests for sensitivity, specificity and stability. It was convenient for both collection and testing to take the required samples of whole blood by finger prick. A cross-sectional survey revealed VL point prevalences of 4.40\% in Trishal and 6.75\% in Shahjadpur, compared with an extremely low rate of 0.34\% in non-endemic Teknaf. In both endemic upazilas (Trishal and Shahjadpur) VL was more prevalent (2.56-4.5\%) in persons up to 20 years of age than in those 21 years of age and older (1.84-2.25\%).

To assess the prevalence of counterfeit antimalarial drugs in Southeast (SE) Asia.


DESIGN

Cross-sectional survey.


SETTING

Pharmacies and shops selling antimalarial drugs in Myanmar (Burma), Lao PDR, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

Proportion of artemisinin derivatives or mefloquine containing drugs of substandard quality.


RESULTS

Of the 188 tablet packs purchased which were labelled as 'artesunate' 53\% did not contain any artesunate. All counterfeit artesunate tablets were labelled as manufactured by 'Guilin Pharma', and refinements of the fake blisterpacks made them often hard to distinguish from their genuine counterparts. No other artemisinin derivatives were found to be counterfeited. Of the 44 mefloquine samples, 9\% contained {\textless}10\% of the expected amount of active ingredient.


CONCLUSIONS

An alarmingly high proportion of antimalarial drugs bought in pharmacies and shops in mainland SE Asia are counterfeit, and the problem has increased significantly compared with our previous survey in 1999-2000. This is a serious threat to public health in the region.},

In addition, tissue tolerance was evaluated. 2. Enrofloxacin was well absorbed, but showed a short permanence after both administration routes. After multiple dose administrations the maximum and minimum peak plasma concentrations were very similar for both routes, obtaining a steady state phase from the second dose that extended until the last evaluated administration. 3. There was no significant accumulation after multiple IM or SC doses; however, there were differences in a fluctuation index after multiple intramuscular administrations that could be related to muscle damage. 4. The different microbiological efficacy indicators (PK/PD indices) obtained, the pharmacokinetic behaviour and CK serum concentrations suggest that subcutaneous enrofloxacin administration of 15 mg/kg every 12 h produce and maintain an efficient concentration of antibiotic that is a safer and more effective therapeutic option than intramuscular administration.},

	abstract = {From the early 1900s, visceral leishmaniasis (VL; kala-azar) has been among the most important health problems in Sudan, particularly in the main endemic area in the eastern and central regions. Several major epidemics have occurred, the most recent—in Western Upper Nile province in southern Sudan, detected in 1988 — claiming over 100000 lives. The disease spread to other areas that were previously not known to be endemic for VL. A major upsurge in the number of cases was noted in the endemic area. These events triggered renewed interest in the disease. Epidemiological and entomological studies confirmed Phlebotomus orientalis as the vector in several parts of the country, typically associated with Acacia seyal and Balanites aegyptiaca vegetation. Infection rates with Leishmania were high, but subject to seasonal variation, as were the numbers of sand flies. Parasites isolated from humans and sand flies belonged to three zymodemes (MON-18, MON-30 and MON-82), which all belong to the L. donovani sensu lato cluster. Transmission dynamics have not been elucidated fully; heavy transmission in relatively scarcely populated areas such as Dinder national park suggested zoonotic transmission whereas the large numbers of patients with post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) in heavily affected villages may indicate a human reservoir and anthroponotic transmission. Clinical presentation in adults and in children did not differ significantly, except that children were more anaemic. Fever, weight loss, hepato-splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy were the most common findings. PKDL was much more common than expected (56\% of patients with VL developed PKDL), but other post-VL manifestations were also found affecting the eyes (uveitis, conjunctivitis, blepharitis), nasal and/or oral mucosa. Evaluation of diagnostic methods showed that parasitological diagnosis should still be the mainstay in diagnosis, with sensitivities for lymph node, bone marrow and spleen aspirates of 58\%, 70\% and 96\%, respectively. Simple, cheap serological tests are needed. The direct agglutination test (DAT) had a sensitivity of 72\%, specificity of 94\%, positive predictive value of 78\% and negative predictive value of 92\%. As with other serological tests, the DAT cannot distinguish between active disease, subclinical infection or past infection. The introduction of freeze-dried antigen and control sera greatly improved the practicality and accuracy of the DAT in the field. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant K39 antigen had higher sensitivity than DAT (93\%). The polymerase chain reaction using peripheral blood gave a sensitivity of 70–93\% and was more sensitive than microscopy of lymph node or bone marrow aspirates in patients with suspected VL. The leishmanin skin test (LST) was typically negative during active VL and converted to positive in c. 80\% of patients 6 months after treatment. Immunological studies showed that both Th1 and Th2 cell responses could be demonstrated in lymph nodes from VL patients as evidenced by the presence of messenger ribonucleic acid for interleukin (IL)-10, interferon γ and IL-2. Treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from VL patients with IL-12 was found to drive the immune response toward a Th1 type response with the production of interferon γ, indicating a potential therapeutic role for IL-12. VL responded well to treatment with sodium stibogluconate, which is still the first line drug at a dose of 20 mg/kg intravenously or intramuscularly per day for 15–30 d. Side effects and resistance were rare. Liposomal amphotericin B was effective, with few side effects. Control measures have not been implemented. Based on observations that VL does not occur in individuals who have a positive LST, probably because of previous cutaneous leishmaniasis, a vaccine containing heat-killed L. major promastigotes is currently undergoing a phase III trial.},

Poor-quality antimalarial drugs lead to drug resistance and inadequate treatment, which pose an urgent threat to vulnerable populations and jeopardise progress and investments in combating malaria. Emergence of artemisinin resistance or tolerance in Plasmodium falciparum on the Thailand–Cambodia border makes protection of the effectiveness of the drug supply imperative. We reviewed published and unpublished studies reporting chemical analyses and assessments of packaging of antimalarial drugs. Of 1437 samples of drugs in five classes from seven countries in southeast Asia, 497 (35\%) failed chemical analysis, 423 (46\%) of 919 failed packaging analysis, and 450 (36\%) of 1260 were classified as falsified. In 21 surveys of drugs from six classes from 21 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, 796 (35\%) of 2297 failed chemical analysis, 28 (36\%) of 77 failed packaging analysis, and 79 (20\%) of 389 were classified as falsified. Data were insufficient to identify the frequency of substandard (products resulting from poor manufacturing) antimalarial drugs, and packaging analysis data were scarce. Concurrent interventions and a multifaceted approach are needed to define and eliminate criminal production, distribution, and poor manufacturing of antimalarial drugs. Empowering of national medicine regulatory authorities to protect the global drug supply is more important than ever.},

	abstract = {Most studies on global health inequality consider unequal health care and socio-economic conditions but neglect inequality in the production of health knowledge relevant to addressing disease burden. We demonstrate this inequality and identify likely causes. Using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 111 prominent medical conditions, assessed globally and nationally by the World Health Organization, we linked DALYs with MEDLINE articles for each condition to assess the influence of DALY-based global disease burden, compared to the global market for treatment, on the production of relevant MEDLINE articles, systematic reviews, clinical trials and research using animal models vs. humans. We then explored how DALYs, wealth, and the production of research within countries correlate with this global pattern. We show that global DALYs for each condition had a small, significant negative relationship with the production of each type of MEDLINE articles for that condition. Local processes of health research appear to be behind this. Clinical trials and animal studies but not systematic reviews produced within countries were strongly guided by local DALYs. More and less developed countries had very different disease profiles and rich countries publish much more than poor countries. Accordingly, conditions common to developed countries garnered more clinical research than those common to less developed countries. Many of the health needs in less developed countries do not attract attention among developed country researchers who produce the vast majority of global health knowledge—including clinical trials—in response to their own local needs. This raises concern about the amount of knowledge relevant to poor populations deficient in their own research infrastructure. We recommend measures to address this critical dimension of global health inequality.},

Recent studies from the neighbouring state of Bihar, India, have shown a dramatic fall in cure rates with treatment failure occurring in up to 65\% of VL patients treated with SSG. A prospective study was conducted at a tertiary-level hospital located in south-eastern Nepal from July 1999 to January 2001. Parasitologically proven kala-azar patients with no previous history of treatment for VL were treated with SSG 20 mg/kg/d for 30 d which was extended to 40 d in those with persistent positive parasitology. Of the 110 patients who completed SSG therapy and were assessed at 1 and 6 months, definite cure was achieved in 99 patients (90\%) and SSG failure occurred in 11 patients (10\%). Except for the presence of hepatomegaly and a lower platelet count there was no clinical or laboratory baseline characteristic associated with treatment failure. A significantly lower cure rate (76\%, P = 0.03) was observed in patients from the district of Saptari, which borders the antimony-resistant VL areas of Bihar. The efficacy of SSG as a first-line treatment for VL in south-eastern Nepal was still satisfactory, except for the patients living closer to the antimony-resistant VL areas of India. These findings indicate that the spread of resistance to antimonials is already taking place in Nepal and that a policy to control further spread should be urgently implemented.},

The results obtained suggest that antibody detection techniques, the antigen detection in urine (KAtex kit), and Leishmania nested PCR (LnPCR) analysis of the blood could be used for diagnosis of the first clinical episode. After treatment, clinical improvement was associated with negativization of Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle culture and microscopy of bone marrow aspirate, KAtex test, and LnPCR blood analysis results. Interestingly, LnPCR analysis of the bone marrow aspirate showed that sterile cure was not achieved in eight patients, two of which suffered a relapse within 10 to 20 weeks. All of the new noninvasive techniques tested showed high diagnostic sensitivity. However, LnPCR analysis of the bone marrow was the most sensitive; this test was able to detect the persistence of parasites and predict potential relapses.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a major health problem in developing countries. The untreated disease is fatal, available treatment is expensive and often toxic, and drug resistance is increasing. Improved treatment options are needed. Paromomycin was shown to be an efficacious first-line treatment with low toxicity in India.
METHODS: This was a 3-arm multicentre, open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial to compare three treatment regimens for VL in East Africa: paromomycin sulphate (PM) at 15 mg/kg/day for 21 days versus sodium stibogluconate (SSG) at 20 mg/kg/day for 30 days; and the combination of both dose regimens for 17 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was cure based on parasite-free tissue aspirates taken 6 months after treatment.
FINDINGS: Overall, 135 patients per arm were enrolled at five centres in Sudan (2 sites), Kenya (1) and Ethiopia (2), when the PM arm had to be discontinued due to poor efficacy. The trial has continued with the higher dose of PM as well as the combination of PM and SSG arms. These results will be reported later. Baseline patient characteristics were similar among treatment arms. The overall cure with PM was significantly inferior to that with SSG (63.8\% versus 92.2\%; difference 28.5\%, 95\%CI 18.8\% to 38.8\%, p{\textless}0.001). The efficacy of PM varied among centres and was significantly lower in Sudan (14.3\% and 46.7\%) than in Kenya (80.0\%) and Ethiopia (75.0\% and 96.6\%). No major safety issues with PM were identified.
CONCLUSION: The efficacy of PM at 15 mg/kg/day for 21 days was inadequate, particularly in Sudan. The efficacy of higher doses and the combination treatment warrant further studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are 500,000 cases per year of visceral leishmaniasis, which occurs primarily in the Indian subcontinent. Almost all untreated patients die, and all the effective agents have been parenteral. Miltefosine is an oral agent that has been shown in small numbers of patients to have a favorable therapeutic index for Indian visceral leishmaniasis. We performed a clinical trial in India comparing miltefosine with the most effective standard treatment, amphotericin B.
METHODS: The study was a randomized, open-label comparison, in which 299 patients 12 years of age or older received orally administered miltefosine (50 or 100 mg [approximately 2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight] daily for 28 days) and 99 patients received intravenously administered amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram every other day for a total of 15 injections).
RESULTS: The groups were well matched in terms of age, weight, proportion with previous failure of treatment for leishmaniasis, parasitologic grade of splenic aspirate, and splenomegaly. At the end of treatment, splenic aspirates were obtained from 293 patients in the miltefosine group and 98 patients in the amphotericin B group. No parasites were identified, for an initial cure rate of 100 percent. By six months after the completion of treatment, 282 of the 299 patients in the miltefosine group (94 percent [95 percent confidence interval, 91 to 97]) and 96 of the 99 patients in the amphotericin B group (97 percent) had not had a relapse; these patients were classified as cured. Vomiting and diarrhea, generally lasting one to two days, occurred in 38 percent and 20 percent of the patients in the miltefosine group, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral miltefosine is an effective and safe treatment for Indian visceral leishmaniasis. Miltefosine may be particularly advantageous because it can be administered orally. It may also be helpful in regions where parasites are resistant to current agents.},

Few studies are available regarding the production of cytokines in the subclinical form of VL, with only the production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha known. The aim of the present study was to identify immunological markers for the oligosymptomatic or subclinical form of VL. A prospective cohort study was conducted on 784 children aged 0 to 5 years from an endemic area in the State of Maranhão, Brazil, between January 1998 and December 2001. During 30 consecutive months of follow-up, 33 children developed the oligosymptomatic form of the disease and 12 the acute form. During the clinical manifestations, serum cytokine levels were determined in 27 oligosymptomatic children and in nine patients with the acute form using a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay. In the subclinical form of VL, variable levels of IL-2 were detected in 52.3\% of the children, IL-12 in 85.2\%, IFN-gamma in 48.1\%, IL-10 in 88.9\%, and TNF-alpha in 100.0\%, with the last two cytokines showing significantly lower levels than in the acute form. IL-4 was not detected in oligosymptomatic individuals. Multiple discriminant analysis used to determine the profile or combination of cytokines predominating in the subclinical form revealed both a Leishmania resistance (Th1) and susceptibility (Th2) profile. The detection of both Th1 and Th2 cytokine profiles explains the self-limited evolution accompanied by the discrete alterations observed for the subclinical form of VL.},

Miltefosine is the first oral drug with demonstrable success in treating visceral leishmaniasis in adults. Because approximately one-half of the visceral leishmaniasis patients worldwide are children, we performed a Phase I/II dose ranging study in the pediatric population in India.


METHODS

Thirty-nine (39) children (defined as {\textless} 12 years of age) with visceral leishmaniasis demonstrated by parasites in splenic aspirates, were treated with oral miltefosine daily for 28 days: 21 patients received 1.5 mg/kg/day (Group A); and 18 patients received 2.5 mg/kg/day (Group B). About one-half of these children had failed prior antileishmanial treatment.


RESULTS

All patients were parasitologically negative and symptomatically improved by the end of therapy on Day 28 of therapy; the initial parasitologic cure rate was 100\%. Two patients in each treatment group relapsed with fever, splenomegaly and parasite-positive splenic aspirates by the end of the 6-month follow-up. The per protocol final clinical cure rate was 19 of 21 = 90\% in Group A and 15 of 17 = 88\% in Group B. Miltefosine was well-tolerated. As per the adult experience, gastrointestinal adverse events were seen: 33 and 39\% of children experienced vomiting and 5 and 17\% experienced diarrhea in Groups A and B, respectively, but all episodes were mild to moderate in severity and commonly lasted {\textless}1 day without symptomatic treatment.


CONCLUSION

Oral miltefosine was safe and approximately 90\% effective in this initial clinical trial of childhood visceral leishmaniasis.},

Quantitative proteomics using stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) was used to better characterize cytoplasmic and membrane-enriched (ME) proteomes of the in vitro generated Leishmania infantum AmB resistant mutant AmB1000.1. In total, 97 individual proteins were found as differentially expressed between the mutant and its parental sensitive strain (WT). More than half of these proteins were either metabolic enzymes or involved in transcription or translation processes. Key energetic pathways such as glycolysis and TCA cycle were up-regulated in the mutant. Interestingly, many proteins involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and heat-shock proteins were also up-regulated in the resistant mutant. This work provides a basis for further investigations to understand the roles of proteins differentially expressed in relation with AmB resistance.},

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may interfere with calcium absorption through induction of hypochlorhydria but they also may reduce bone resorption through inhibition of osteoclastic vacuolar proton pumps.


OBJECTIVE

To determine the association between PPI therapy and risk of hip fracture.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS

A nested case-control study was conducted using the General Practice Research Database (1987-2003), which contains information on patients in the United Kingdom. The study cohort consisted of users of PPI therapy and nonusers of acid suppression drugs who were older than 50 years. Cases included all patients with an incident hip fracture. Controls were selected using incidence density sampling, matched for sex, index date, year of birth, and both calendar period and duration of up-to-standard follow-up before the index date. For comparison purposes, a similar nested case-control analysis for histamine 2 receptor antagonists was performed.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE

The risk of hip fractures associated with PPI use.


RESULTS

There were 13,556 hip fracture cases and 135,386 controls. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for hip fracture associated with more than 1 year of PPI therapy was 1.44 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-1.59). The risk of hip fracture was significantly increased among patients prescribed long-term high-dose PPIs (AOR, 2.65; 95\% CI, 1.80-3.90; P{\textless}.001). The strength of the association increased with increasing duration of PPI therapy (AOR for 1 year, 1.22 [95\% CI, 1.15-1.30]; 2 years, 1.41 [95\% CI, 1.28-1.56]; 3 years, 1.54 [95\% CI, 1.37-1.73]; and 4 years, 1.59 [95\% CI, 1.39-1.80]; P{\textless}.001 for all comparisons).


CONCLUSION

Long-term PPI therapy, particularly at high doses, is associated with an increased risk of hip fracture.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES

Acanthamoebae can cause infections of several organs, including eye, skin, lung and brain. Except for Acanthamoeba keratitis, these infections are linked to immunodeficiency. Treatment is generally problematic, due to the lack of sufficiently effective and also easily manageable drugs. In a previous study we discovered that miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine) is highly active against Acanthamoeba spp. in vitro. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the suitability of miltefosine for the topical treatment of Acanthamoeba infections.


METHODS

Storage life and time dependency, susceptibilities of opportunistic bacterial and fungal pathogens, and synergistic and adverse effects of combinations with other anti-Acanthamoeba substances were determined. Moreover, an organotypic skin equivalent was adapted for investigating the penetration of acanthamoebae into the epidermis and the human tissue tolerability of miltefosine.


RESULTS

It was shown that miltefosine can be stored as a 2 mM stock solution and also as a 50 microM dilution over a period of 12 months at 4 degrees C without any loss of activity. Efficacies against staphylococci and Candida albicans were established. Acanthamoebae were able to penetrate the skin equivalent within 24 h. This penetration was prevented by treatment with miltefosine, while miltefosine treatment was well tolerated by the skin equivalent.


CONCLUSIONS

Miltefosine has been approved for oral and topical treatment of leishmaniasis and may also be a promising candidate for the topical treatment of Acanthamoeba infections.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of HIV/malaria-coinfected patients with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and artemisinin-based combination therapy has potential for drug interactions. We investigated the pharmacokinetics of artemether, dihydroartemisinin and lumefantrine after administration of a single dose of 80/480 mg of artemether/lumefantrine to HIV-infected adults, taken with and without lopinavir/ritonavir.
METHODS: A two-arm parallel study of 13 HIV-infected ART-naive adults and 16 HIV-infected adults stable on 400/100 mg of lopinavir/ritonavir plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 00619944). Each participant received a single dose of 80/480 mg of artemether/lumefantrine under continuous cardiac function monitoring. Plasma concentrations of artemether, dihydroartemisinin and lumefantrine were measured.
RESULTS: Co-administration of artemether/lumefantrine with lopinavir/ritonavir significantly reduced artemether maximum concentration (C(max)) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) [median (range): 112 (20-362) versus 56 (17-236) ng/mL, P = 0.03; and 264 (92-1129) versus 151 (38-606) ng · h/mL, P {\textless} 0.01]. Dihydroartemisinin C(max) and AUC were not affected [66 (10-111) versus 73 (31-224) ng/mL, P = 0.55; and 213 (68-343) versus 175 (118-262) ng · h/mL P = 0.27]. Lumefantrine C(max) and AUC increased during co-administration [2532 (1071-5957) versus 7097 (2396-9462) ng/mL, P {\textless} 0.01; and 41,119 (12,850-125,200) versus 199,678 (71,205-251,015) ng · h/mL, P {\textless} 0.01].
CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of artemether/lumefantrine with lopinavir/ritonavir significantly increases lumefantrine exposure, but decreases artemether exposure. Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic trials will be highly valuable in evaluating the clinical significance of this interaction and determining whether dosage modifications are indicated.},

We assessed the impact of potential improvements in chemotherapy on the cost-effectiveness of VL test-treatment strategies. Competing test-treatment strategies were compared in a formal decision analysis - from the viewpoint of the clinician facing a VL suspect -, with avoided VL-mortality and cost as outcomes of interest. Sensitivity analysis was done involving the following parameters: efficacy, toxicity and cost of treatment including patient care. When safer and more efficacious drugs are considered, they only result in a more cost-effective strategy if the total cost of treatment falls below US\$ 390 per patient.

METHODS: A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption was chosen for investigation. Methods evaluated were: discarding BQL observations (M1), discarding BQL observations but adjusting the likelihood for the remaining data (M2), maximizing the likelihood for the data above the limit of quantification (LOQ) and treating BQL data as censored (M3), and like M3 but conditioning on the observation being greater than zero (M4). These four methods were compared using data simulated with a proportional error model. M2, M3, and M4 were also compared using data simulated from a positively truncated normal distribution. Successful terminations and bias and precision of parameter estimates were assessed.
RESULTS: For the data simulated with a proportional error model, the overall performance was best for M3 followed by M2 and M1. M3 and M4 resulted in similar estimates in analyses without log transformation. For data simulated with the truncated normal distribution, M4 performed better than M3.
CONCLUSIONS: Analyses that maximized the likelihood of the data above the LOQ and treated BQL data as censored provided the most accurate and precise parameter estimates.},

The molecular mechanisms that contribute to the antileishmanial activity of HePC are still unknown. We report that in wild-type promastigotes of Leishmania donovani HePC is able to induce a cell death process with numerous cytoplasmic, nuclear, and membrane features of metazoan apoptosis, including cell shrinkage, DNA fragmentation into oligonucleosome-sized fragments, and phosphatidylserine exposure. None of these changes were detected in an HePC-resistant clone treated with the same drug concentration. Therefore, HePC does not appear to kill L. donovani promastigotes by a direct toxic mechanism but, rather, kills the promastigotes by an indirect one. Pretreatment of wild-type promastigotes with two broad caspase inhibitors, z-Val-Ala-dl-Asp(methoxy)-fluoromethylketone and Boc-Asp(methoxy)-fluoromethylketone, as well as a broad protease inhibitor, calpain inhibitor I, prior to drug exposure interfered with DNA fragmentation but did not prevent cell shrinkage or phosphatidylserine externalization. These data suggest that at least part of the apoptotic machinery operating in wild-type promastigotes involves proteases. Identification of the death-signaling pathways activated in HePC-sensitive parasites appears to be essential for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action and resistance in these parasites.},

	abstract = {Although the existence of O -acetylated sialic acids is well known, it is only in recent years that steady refinement of analytical techniques have enabled detailed mapping of their structural diversity [1]. Fluorimetric analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) showed six fold increase in the percentage of surface 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates (9-O-AcSGs) as compared to normal human donors. Using Achatinin-H, a 9-O-acetyl sialic acid- binding lectin, an enhanced presence of 9-O-AcSGs in an alpha2 --{\textgreater} 6 linkage was demonstrated by flow cytometry; abolition of its binding by pretreatment with a recombinant 9-O-acetylesterase corroborated the presence of this glycotope. Western blotting of PBMC from VL patients indicated the presence of five O-acetylated sialoglycans corresponding to 144, 65, 56, 36 and 19 kDa as compared to 144 and 36 kDa in normal individuals. Taken together our data indicates that during active disease, there is an overexpression of 9AcSGs on the surface of PBMC of VL patients, thus opening up new research avenues wherein the expression of this biomarker could be exploited to monitor the clinical status of VL patients.},

	abstract = {We sought to estimate visceral leishmaniasis (VL) burden in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal and document care-seeking behaviour for VL to provide baseline information for monitoring the VL elimination program and identify options for improved case finding and management.

A cross-sectional study using cluster sampling (clusters being villages) of 4 VL endemic districts was used in order to document all current and existing VL cases over the preceding 12 mo. Extended (in-depth) interviews were conducted in a subsample of households to explore (a) VL-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the population; (b) use of VL care by patients; and (c) delay between onset of symptoms, diagnosis, and start of treatment, as well as treatment interruption. Findings were discussed with national program managers and policy makers to develop improved strategies.

Screening for VL was done in 18,933 households (106,425 inhabitants). The estimated annual incidence of VL in the endemic districts was on average 22 times higher than the elimination target of less than one case per 10,000 inhabitants in 2015. This incidence varied widely between study sites, from 9.0 to 29.8 per 10,000 inhabitants. The percentage of newly detected cases through the household screening was high in the districts least covered by health-care services (particularly Rajshahi, Bangladesh, 49\%; and to a lesser extent Vaishali in Bihar, India, 32.5\%), and much lower in districts with greater availability of VL care (Muzaffarpur, India, 3.8\%). On average 267 houses had to be visited, i.e., at least three to four working days per health worker, to identify a new VL (ranging from 1,432 houses in Muzaffarpur, India to only 166 houses in Rajshahi, Bangladesh). Knowledge of the disease and its vectors was good in India and Nepal but poor in Bangladesh (Rajshahi) where very little attention has been given to VL over the last decades. Although all socio-demographic indicators showed high levels of poverty, people in India preferred private medical practitioners for the treatment of VL, whereas in Nepal, and even more in Bangladesh, the public health-care sector was preferred. Delays between onset of symptoms and diagnosis as well as start of treatment was high. Reported non-adherence to treatment was particularly high in the more under-served districts and was mainly due to lack of resources.

The findings suggest that (a) house-to-house screening may be useful in highly endemic districts with a poor passive case detection system, but further evidence on case finding adapted to local conditions has to be collected; (b) strengthening the quality of the public health sector is imperative in the three countries, especially in India, with its largely unregulated private-sector provision of VL care.},

Miltefosine also modulates immune cells such as macrophages, leading to parasite elimination via oxidative radicals. Dendritic cells (DC) are critical for initiation of protective immunity against Leishmania through induction of Th1 immunity via interleukin 12 (IL-12). Here, we investigated the effects of miltefosine on DC in Leishmania major infections. When cocultured with miltefosine for 4 days, the majority of in vitro-infected DC were free of parasites. Miltefosine treatment did not influence DC maturation (upregulation of major histocompatibility complex II [MHC II] or costimulatory molecules, e.g., CD40, CD54, and CD86) or significantly alter cytokine release (IL-12, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], or IL-10). Further, miltefosine DC treatment did not alter antigen presentation, since unrestricted antigen-specific proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was observed upon stimulation with miltefosine-treated, infected DC. In addition, miltefosine application in vivo did not lead to maturation/emigration of skin DC. DC NO− production, a mechanism used by phagocytes to rid themselves of intracellular parasites, was also unaltered upon miltefosine treatment. Our data confirm prior studies indicating that in contrast to, e.g., pentavalent antimonials, miltefosine functions independently of the immune system, mostly through direct toxicity against the Leishmania parasite.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

In Bihar, India, home to nearly one-half of the world's burden of visceral leishmaniasis, drug resistance has ended the usefulness of pentavalent antimony, which is the traditional first-line treatment. Although monotherapy with other agents is available, the use of 2 drugs with different modes of action might increase efficacy, shorten treatment duration, enhance compliance, and/or reduce the risk of parasite resistance. To test the feasibility of a new approach to combination therapy in visceral leishmaniasis (also known a kala-azar), we treated Indian patients with a single infusion of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB), followed 1 day later by short-course oral miltefosine.


METHODS

We used a randomized, noncomparative, group-sequential, triangular design and assigned 181 subjects to treatment with 5 mg/kg of L-AmB alone (group A; 45 subjects), 5 mg/kg of L-AmB followed by miltefosine for 10 days (group B; 46 subjects) or 14 days (group C; 45 subjects), or 3.75 mg/kg of L-AmB followed by miltefosine for 14 days (group D; 45 subjects). When it became apparent that all regimens were effective, 45 additional, nonrandomized patients were assigned to receive 5 mg/kg of L-AmB followed by miltefosine for 7 days (group E).


RESULTS

Each regimen was satisfactorily tolerated, and all 226 subjects showed initial apparent cure responses. Nine months after treatment, final cure rates were similar: group A, 91\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 78\%-97\%]; group B, 98\% (95\% CI, 87\%-100\%); group C, 96\% (95\% CI, 84\%-99\%]; group D, 96\% (95\% CI, 84\%-99\%); and group E, 98\% (95\% CI, 87\%-100\%).


CONCLUSIONS

These results suggest that treatment with single-dose L-AmB followed by 7-14 days of miltefosine is active against Indian kala-azar. This short-course, sequential regimen warrants additional testing in India and in those regions of endemicity where visceral leishmaniasis may be more difficult to treat.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

AmBisome® is an efficacious, safe anti-leishmanial treatment. There is growing interest in its use, either as a single dose or in combination treatments. In East Africa, the minimum optimal single-dosage has not been identified.


METHODS/DESIGN

An open-label, 2-arm, non-inferiority, multi-centre randomised controlled trial is being conducted to determine the optimal single-dose treatment with AmBisome®.Patients in the single-dose arm will receive one infusion on day 1, at a dose depending on body weight. For the first group of patients entered to the trial, the dose will be 7.5 mg/kg, but if this dose is found to be ineffective then in subsequent patient series the dose will be escalated progressively to 10, 12.5 and 15 mg/kg. Patients in the reference arm will receive a multi-dose regimen of AmBisome® (3 mg/kg/day on days 1-5, 14 and 21: total dose 21 mg/kg). Patients will be hospitalised for approximately one month after the start of treatment and then followed up at three and six months. The primary endpoint is the status of patients six months after treatment. A secondary endpoint is assessment at day 30. Treatment success is determined as the absence of parasites on microscopy samples taken from bone marrow, lymph node or splenic aspirates. Interim analyses to assess the comparative efficacy of the single dose are planned after recruitment of 20 and 40 patients per arm. The final non-inferiority analysis will include 120 patients per arm, to determine if the single-dose efficacy 6 months after treatment is not more than 10\% inferior to the multi-dose.


DISCUSSION

An effective, safe single-dose treatment would reduce hospitalization and treatment costs. Results will inform the design of combination treatment studies.

	abstract = {RATIONALE: The dosage of 10 mg/kg/d rifampin, as currently used in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), is not an optimal dose. Shortening of treatment duration might be achievable using an increased rifampin dose.
OBJECTIVES: Determination of optimal rifampin dosage in mice, resulting in maximum therapeutic effect and without adverse effects. Assessment of associated pharmacokinetic parameters and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic indices.
METHODS: A murine TB infection using a Beijing genotype Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain was established by intratracheal bacterial instillation followed by proper inhalation, while keeping mice in a vertical position. We assessed dose-dependent activity of rifampin in single-drug treatment during 3 weeks. The maximum tolerated dosage, pharmacokinetic parameters, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index were determined. Therapeutic efficacy of a range of rifampin (R) dosages added to a regimen of isoniazid (H) and pyrazinamide (Z) was assessed.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Maximum tolerated dosage of rifampin in the murine TB was 160 mg/kg/d. Pharmacokinetic measurement in HR(10)Z and HR(160)Z therapy regimens showed for rifampin a C(max) of 16.2 and 157.3 mg/L, an AUC(0-24h) of 132 and 1,782 h·mg/L, and AUC(0-24h)/minimum inhibitory concentration ratios of 528 and 7129, respectively. A clear dose-effect correlation was observed for rifampin after 3-week single-drug treatment. Administration of HR(80)Z allowed 9-week treatment duration to be effective without relapse of infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the currently used rifampin dosage in the therapy of TB is too low. In our murine TB model a rifampin dosage of 80 mg/kg/d enabled a significant reduction in therapy duration without adverse effects.},

Since macrophage activation plays an important role in the control of Mycobacterium leprae infection, we studied the association of chitotriosidase with leprosy both in serum and in situ in lesional skin biopsies from patients. Serum samples from 78 Indonesian leprosy patients (39 non-reactional and 39 reactional leprosy patients) and 36 healthy controls (HC) from the same endemic region were investigated. The patients were classified as multibacillary (MB, n=69) or paucibacillary (PB, n=9) based on the bacterial index in slit-skin smears. Thirty-six of the reactional patients had erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), while only 3 had reversal reaction (RR). Follow-up serum samples after corticosteroid treatment were also obtained from 17 patients with ENL and one with RR. Multibacillary (MB) patients showed increased chitotriosidase activity in serum as compared to paucibacillary (PB) patients and healthy controls. Although no significant difference was observed between reactional and the corresponding non-reactional groups, ENL showed significantly higher chitotriosidase activity as compared to HC. Furthermore, corticosteroid treatment resulted in significant decline of enzyme activity in ENL sera. Chitotriosidase activity correlated with levels of neopterin, another macrophage activation marker, but not with IL-6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-10. Immunohistochemical staining of 6 MB (LL=5, BL=1) lesional skin sections from stored material showed positive staining for chitotriosidase within lipid-laden macrophages suggesting that macrophages are the source of the enzyme detected in serum. Thus, serum chitotriosidase activity is potentially useful in distinguishing MB from PB leprosy and in monitoring response to therapy in ENL.},

Combination trials in areas with antileishmanial drug resistance, and treatment and secondary prophylaxis trials in VL-human immunodeficiency virus-coinfected patients, are important to safeguard the current armamentarium and to optimize regimens. The public health community should work to broaden access to preferential liposomal amphotericin B pricing by public sector VL treatment programs.},

	abstract = {Background
HIV-1 infected macrophages and microglia are long-lived viral reservoirs persistently producing viral progenies. HIV-1 infection extends the life span of macrophages by promoting the stress-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt cell survival pathway. Importantly, various cancers also display the PI3K/Akt activation for long-term cell survival and outgrowth, and Akt inhibitors have been extensively searched as anti-cancer agents. This led us to investigate whether Akt inhibitors could antagonize long-term survival and cytoprotective phenotype of HIV-1 infected macrophages.

Principal Findings
Here, we examined the effect of one such class of drugs, alkylphospholipids (ALPs), on cell death and Akt pathway signals in human macrophages and a human microglial cell line, CHME5, infected with HIV-1 BaL or transduced with HIV-1 vector, respectively. Our findings revealed that the ALPs, perifosine and edelfosine, specifically induced the death of HIV-1 infected primary human macrophages and CHME5 cells. Furthermore, these two compounds reduced phosphorylation of both Akt and GSK3β, a downstream substrate of Akt, in the transduced CHME5 cells. Additionally, we observed that perifosine effectively reduced viral production in HIV-1 infected primary human macrophages. These observations demonstrate that the ALP compounds tested are able to promote cell death in both HIV-1 infected macrophages and HIV-1 expressing CHME5 cells by inhibiting the action of the PI3K/Akt pathway, ultimately restricting viral production from the infected cells.

Significance
This study suggests that Akt inhibitors, such as ALP compounds, may serve as potential anti-HIV-1 agents specifically targeting long-living HIV-1 macrophages and microglia reservoirs.},

	abstract = {The usefulness of antigen detection in urine as an alternative tool for diagnosis of leishmaniasis and post-treatment follow-up in patients with Leishmania-HIV coinfection was evaluated with a latex agglutination test (KAtex; Kalon Biological, UK). Forty-nine HIV-infected patients with visceral leishmaniasis were included in the study. Antigen detection in urine (ADU) was positive in 42 of 49 (sensitivity, 85.7\%) samples obtained during a primary episode. After treatment, a follow-up study in 23 patients was performed by simultaneous ADU and culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 148 determinations. The two methods gave concordant results in 94 cases, 38 of which were positive and 56 negative. In five cases, ADU was negative and culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was positive: two of these cases corresponded to clinical relapses. In 49 cases, culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was negative and ADU was positive. In the absence of clinical symptoms, the detection of parasite antigens in 71 of 130 (54.6\%) urine samples was not associated with clinical disease. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probability of relapse at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months were 16\% (95\%CI, 15-17\%), 20\% (95\%CI, 18-22\%), 31\% (95\%CI, 27-35\%), and 71\% (95\%CI, 52-89\%), respectively, in patients with a positive ADU result. In contrast, when ADU was negative, the probability of relapse was 5\% at 6 months (95\%CI, 2-8\%) (only 2 of 11 patients who relapsed had a negative test). ADU by KAtex is appropriate for primary diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis, for monitoring the efficacy of treatment, and for detection of subclinical infection.},

As part of a study on the mechanisms of action of this drug and on the rates of resistance to this drug, we have been working in vitro with an Leishmania donovani line that was previously shown to be 15-fold more resistant to HePC. We have studied the accumulation of [(14)C]HePC by L. donovani promastigotes and have found a drastic reduction ({\textgreater}95\%) in the ability of the resistant line to internalize the drug. Binding of HePC to the plasma membrane and drug efflux from preloaded cells were similar in both drug-sensitive and -resistant lines, and no [(14)C]HePC metabolism was evident in either line. Resistant parasites were also unable to take up other short-chain phospholipid analogs, independently of their polar head group, even though endocytosis remained unaltered. Finally, HePC uptake was temperature and energy dependent and sensitive to the thiol-reactive agent N-ethylmaleimide. We propose that inward translocation of a short-chain phospholipid across the plasma membrane may exist in Leishmania promastigotes and that such activity is defective in the resistant line.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the antitumour effects of D-21266 in a rodent tumour model. Hexadecylphosphocholine (INN: Miltefosine) represents the first anticancer agent which was specifically formulated for topical use in cancer patients. The development as an oral drug was hampered by the gastrointestinal toxicity. Hexadecylphosphocholine derivatives were sought with a better therapeutic index. Octadecyl-(1,1-dimethyl-4-piperidylio) phosphate (D-21266) was identified as a suitable candidate. This compound is highly active in vitro inhibiting the growth of a number of human cancer cell lines. Mammary carcinomas were induced in Sprague-Dawley rats using DMBA, and oral doses of D-21266, in various schedules, were given to the animals. A high antineoplastic potency was observed without inducing loss of body weight at highly effective doses. The antitumour effect could be enhanced by introducing a dose schedule consisting of a high loading dose followed by a low maintenance dose, both of which are only marginally active when given alone. Therefore, D-21266 with its favourable pharmacological and toxicological profile, warrants evaluation in the clinic. However, the concept of clinical trials requires new approaches to dose finding and response evaluation, because the dose-response relationship of this compound is distinctly different from that of classical cytostatic agents.},

The inter-stage MIL susceptibility correlated strongly (r = 0.70, p = 0.0018) using J774.A.1 macrophage cell line-based amastigote assay and fluorescence-based resazurin assay for promastigotes. Investigation of inter-stage MIL susceptibility for the same set of clinical isolates in another lab also showed a strong correlation (r = 0.72, p = 0.0012) using mouse peritoneal macrophages for amastigote assay and resazurin-based alamar blue assay for promastigotes. Additionally, parasites from post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) lesions (n = 7, r = 0.78, p = 0.046) and MIL-induced parasites (r = 0.92, p = 0.0001; n = 3) also exhibited a strongly correlated inter-stage miltefosine susceptibility. Thus, our results support the utility of resazurin assay as a simplified biological tool for MIL susceptibility monitoring in clinical isolates from MIL-treated VL/PKDL patients.},

We provide an overview of the various guidelines concerning HAT and leishmaniasis over the past decades and show the confusion in the calculation of the dosage of pentamidine in these guidelines and the subsequent published reports on clinical trials and reviews. At present, only pentamidine isethionate is available, but the advised dosage for HAT and leishmaniasis is (historically) based on the amount of pentamidine base. In the treatment of leishmaniasis this is probably resulting in a subtherapeutic treatment. There is thus a need for a new, more transparent and concise guideline concerning the dosage of pentamidine, at least in the treatment of HAT and leishmaniasis.},

The cure rates with 6 months of follow-up were statistically similar: 36 of 41 evaluable miltefosine patients (88\%) versus 15 of 16 (94\%) evaluable antimony patients.

The two conclusions from this work are that oral miltefosine can be used for cutaneous disease in this part of Bolivia and that miltefosine was more effective for L. braziliensis in this region than for L. braziliensis in Guatemala.

	abstract = {In today's scientific and regulatory climates, an increased emphasis is placed on the potential health impacts for children exposed either in utero or by nursing to drugs of abuse, pharmaceuticals, and industrial or consumer chemicals. As a result, there is a renewed interest in the development and application of biologically based computational models that can be used to predict the dosimetry (or ultimately response) in a developing embryo, fetus, or newborn. However, fundamental differences between animal and human development can create many unique challenges. For example, unlike models designed for adults,biologically based models of pre-and postnatal development must deal with rapidly changing growth dynamics (maternal embryonic, fetal, and neonatal), changes in the state of differentiation of developing tissues, uniquely expressed or uniquely functioning signal transduction or enzymatic pathways, and unusual routes of exposure (e.g., maternal-mediated placental transfer and lactation). In cases where these challenges are overcome or addressed, biological modeling will likely prove useful in assessments geared toward children's health, given the contributions that this approach has already made in cancer and non-cancer human health risk assessments. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the current state of the art in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling of the developing embryo, fetus, or neonate and to recommend potential steps that could be taken to improve their use in children's health risk assessments. The intent was not to recommend improvements to individual models per se, but to identify areas of research that could move the entire field forward. This analysis includes a brief summary of current risk assessment practices for developmental toxicity, with an overview of developmental biology as it relates to species-specific dosimetry. This summary should provide a general context for understanding the tension that exists in modeling between describing biological proceses in exquisite detail vs. the simplifications that are necessary due to lack of data (or through a sensitivity analysis, determined to be of little impact) to develop individual PBPK or PD models. For each of the previously published models covered in this review, a description of the underlying assumptions and model structures as well as the data and methods used in model development and validation are highlighted. Although several of the models attempted to describe target tissues in the developing embryo, fetus, or neonate of laboratory animals, extrapolations to humans were largely limited to maternal blood or milk concentrations. Future areas of research therefore are recommended to extend the already significant progress that has been made in this field and perhaps address many of the technical policy, and ethical issues surrounding various approaches for decreasing the uncertainty in extrapolating from animal models to human pregnancies or neonatal exposures.},

Moreover, the expression level of the apoptosis activator Fas, and Fas/Fas ligand signaling capacity are not attributing factors for the preference toward apoptosis. Using Fas siRNA and overexpression approaches we establish that Fas is not a pro-apoptotic factor but a contributor to cell protection in HePC-apoptosis-sensitive cells. The insight in the multi-modal anticancer capability of HePC in triple-negative breast cancer cells may facilitate the targeted design of therapeutic strategies against triple-negative breast cancers.},

H. pylori infection represents a key factor in the etiology of various gastrointestinal diseases, ranging from chronic active gastritis without clinical symptoms to peptic ulceration, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Disease outcome is the result of the complex interplay between the host and the bacterium. Host immune gene polymorphisms and gastric acid secretion largely determine the bacterium's ability to colonize a specific gastric niche. Bacterial virulence factors such as the cytotoxin-associated gene pathogenicity island-encoded protein CagA and the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA aid in this colonization of the gastric mucosa and subsequently seem to modulate the host's immune system. This review focuses on the microbiological, clinical, immunological, and biochemical aspects of the pathogenesis of H. pylori.},

Anthroponotic VL foci are of special concern as they are at the origin of frequent and deathly epidemics (e.g. Sudan). Leishmaniasis burden remains important: 88 countries, 350 million people at risk, 500,000 new cases of VL per year, 1-1.5 million for CL and DALYs: 2.4 millions. Most of the burden is concentrated on few countries which allows clear geographic priorities. Leishmaniasis is still an important public health problem due to not only environmental risk factors such as massive migrations, urbanisation, deforestation, new irrigation schemes, but also to individual risk factors: HIV, malnutrition, genetic, etc em leader Leishmaniasis is part of those diseases which still requires improved control tools. Consequently WHO/TDR research for leishmaniasis has been more and more focusing on the development of new tools such as diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines. The ongoing effort has already produced significant results. The newly available control tools should allow a scaling up of control activities in priority areas. In anthroponotic foci, the feasibility of getting a strong impact on mortality, morbidity and transmission, is high.},

Dried blood spot (DBS) sampling is an attractive alternative to plasma sampling for pharmacokinetic studies in these remote areas, but introduces additional variability in analyte quantification due to possible blood spot inhomogeneity and variability in blood spot volume and haematocrit values. Volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) potentially overcomes a few of these issues as the VAMS device absorbs a fixed volume that is processed as a whole. We developed and validated an LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of miltefosine with this novel sampling technique with good performance in terms of linearity, selectivity, accuracy (bias within ±10.8\%), precision (CV\%≤11.9\%), recovery, carry-over and matrix effect. VAMS samples were stable for at least one month at room temperature and 37°C. The impact of haematocrit on assay accuracy was reduced compared to conventional DBS sampling, but indicated a declining recovery with increased haematocrit due to haematocrit dependency in recovery from the sampling device. A clinical validation will be required to investigate whether VAMS is an appropriate and cost-effective alternative sampling method to conventional DBS sampling.},

	abstract = {Summary
Governed by parasite and host factors and immunoinflammatory responses, the clinical spectrum of leishmaniasis encompasses subclinical (inapparent), localised (skin lesions), and disseminated infection (cutaneous, mucosal, or visceral). Symptomatic disease is subacute or chronic and diverse in presentation and outcome. Clinical characteristics vary further by endemic region. Despite T-cell-dependent immune responses, which produce asymptomatic and self-healing infection, or appropriate treatment, intracellular infection is probably life-long since targeted cells (tissue macrophages) allow residual parasites to persist. There is an epidemic of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and Pakistan and of visceral infection in India and Sudan. Diagnosis relies on visualising parasites in tissue or serology; culture and detection of parasite DNA are useful in the laboratory. Pentavalent antimony is the conventional treatment; however, resistance of visceral infection in India has spawned new treatment approaches--amphotericin B and its lipid formulations, injectable paromomycin, and oral miltefosine. Despite tangible advances in diagnosis, treatment, and basic scientific research, leishmaniasis is embedded in poverty and neglected. Current obstacles to realistic prevention and proper management include inadequate vector (sandfly) control, no vaccine, and insufficient access to or impetus for developing affordable new drugs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Chronic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use is common in the Western world. Socio-economic status and socio-demographic factors have been shown to influence decisions related to prescribing of various drugs, but the influence of these factors on chronic PPI use is uncertain.


AIM

To study the influence of SES and socio-demographic factors on chronic PPI use.


METHODS

Data were collected from a database of a Dutch health insurance company. Subjects having had at least one prescription for a PPI were identified and followed up for 6 months. Patients were then subdivided into chronic PPI users. Socio-demographic status was based on neighbourhood level of residence. Logistic regression was performed to determine socio-demographic factors associated with PPI use.


RESULTS

A total of 2 001 787 insured individuals were included, 85 253 subjects were chronic users. Both low income (OR 1.55; CI 1.52-1.58) and low educational level (OR 1.33; CI 1.31-1.36) were associated with chronic PPI use. Other independent predictive variables included use of 10 or more concomitant medications (OR 5.33; CI 4.96-5.72) and the use of prokinetic drugs (OR 10.01; CI 9.22-10.88).


CONCLUSIONS

Patients of a lower socio-demographic status are more likely to use PPIs on a chronic basis. The observed gradient in PPIs use may reflect differences in health, healthcare use or healthcare supply.},

As children exhibit increased drug clearance, this may further the benefit of prolonged or continuous infusions. This dosing approach was applied to several beta-lactams commonly utilized in children. PROCEDURE: A variety of cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam regimens using administration times of 0.5, 3, or 24 hr infusions were simulated in populations of 2- and 12-year-old children using Monte Carlo techniques. The probability of target attainment (PTA) was calculated for each dosing regimen. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) frequencies for Pseudomonas aeruginosa were obtained for two pediatric acute care institutions in order to calculate cumulative fractions of response (CFR). RESULTS: Standard 0.5 hr infusions resulted in poor PTA for most study agents at their susceptibility breakpoint, whereas 3 hr infusions markedly improved PTA for cefepime (79 to 100\%), ceftazidime (80 to 100\%), imipenem (41 to 91\%), and meropenem (33 to 97\%). Piperacillin/tazobactam could not achieve a PTA {\textgreater} 21\% for any dosing regimen at its breakpoint, though large improvements were observed at lower MICs. Continuous infusion regimens resulted in similar PTA results to the same dose administered as 3 hr infusions. CFR values for all drugs at both institutions improved when 3 hr or continuous infusions were employed. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged and continuous infusion dosing strategies improved the likelihood of obtaining bactericidal targets for these beta-lactams in a simulated pediatric population. Based on these data, pediatric studies employing these strategies are warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

  Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) constitutes a parasite reservoir important in the transmission of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Unacceptable treatment regimens and increasing drug resistance blight control programmes. The success of oral miltefosine in VL prompted a clinical, histopathological and parasitological study of this drug in PKDL.


OBJECTIVES

To define the dose and duration of miltefosine for treatment of PKDL.


METHODS

Twenty-six patients confirmed by slit-skin smear, histopathology and molecular tests were enrolled in the study. They received miltefosine capsules 50 mg thrice daily after food. Treatment was for 60 days with a provision to increase by 30 days if a responder had not attained a cure. Cure was ascertained by clinical and histopathological examination, and measuring parasite burden using real-time polymerase chain reaction.


RESULTS

Twenty-four patients with a wide range of parasite burden completed the study. Twenty-three achieved a cure giving an initial cure rate of 96\% (95\% confidence interval 79-99\%). Sixteen patients were cured with 50 mg thrice daily, 13 in 60 days and three within 90 days. In seven cases, miltefosine had to be reduced, because of gastrointestinal intolerance, to 50 mg twice daily to a total of 180 capsules. Lesional parasites were undetectable at 1 month post-treatment. Treatment was safe with no relapses at 1-year follow-up.


CONCLUSION

Oral miltefosine, 50mg thrice daily for 60 days or twice daily for 90 days, could be an effective treatment for PKDL.},

We examined and characterized the pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in a group of patients with Old World (L. major) cutaneous leishmaniasis. Methods. Miltefosine plasma concentrations were determined in samples taken during and up to five months after the end of treatment from 31 Dutch military personnel who contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and were treated with 150 mg miltefosine/day for 28 days. Samples were analyzed with a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 4 ng/mL. Population pharmacokinetic modelling was performed with non-linear mixed effects modelling using NONMEM. Results. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine could best be described by an open two-compartment disposition model, with a first elimination half-life of 7.05 days and a terminal elimination half-life of 30.9 days. Median concentration in the last week of treatment (day 22-28) was 30,800 ng/mL. The maximum duration of follow-up was 202 days after the start of treatment. All analyzed samples contained a concentration above the LLOQ. Conclusions. Miltefosine is much slower eliminated from the body than previously thought and is therefore still detectable in human plasma samples taken five months after the end of treatment. The presence of subtherapeutic miltefosine concentrations in the blood beyond five months after treatment might contribute to the selection of resistant parasites and, moreover, the measures for preventing the teratogenic risks of miltefosine should be reconsidered.},

In the majority of cases, PKDL can be diagnosed on the basis of clinical appearance, distribution of the lesions, and past history of treated VL. The ideal diagnostic method is to demonstrate the parasite in smears, by culture or PCR. Diagnosis is particularly difficult in patients who develop PKDL in the absence of previous history of visceral leishmaniasis. We describe a case of cutaneous leishmaniasis misdiagnosed as PKDL and 3 cases of PKDL who were either misdiagnosed or mistreated as other dermatoses. This caused exacerbation of their disease leading to high parasite loads in the lesions and dissemination to internal organs in one of the patients, who was also diabetic. The latter patient had L. major infection. A fourth patient with papulonodular lesions on the face and arms of 17-year duration and who was misdiagnosed as having PKDL is also described. He turned out to have cutaneous leishmaniasis due to L. major. Fortunately, he was not treated with steroids. He was cured with intravenous sodium stibogluconate.},

Piraña provides features for the management and creation of model files, the overview of modeling results, creation of run reports and handling of datasets and output tables, and the running of custom R scripts on model output. Through the secure shell (SSH) protocol, Piraña can also be used to connect to Linux clusters (SGE, MOSIX) for distribution of workload.

This platform is easy to set up, runs in standard network environments, and can be extended with additional nodes if needed. The cluster supports the modeling toolkit Perl speaks NONMEM (PsN), and can include dedicated or non-dedicated PCs. A daemon script, written in Perl, was designed to run in the background on each node in the cluster, and to manage job distribution. The PCluster can be accessed from Piraña, and both software products have extensively been tested on a large academic network. The software is available under an open-source license.},

The standard 28 day miltefosine monotherapy regimen is well tolerated, except for mild gastrointestinal side effects, although its teratogenic potential severely hampers its general use in the clinic and roll-out in national elimination programmes. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine are mainly characterized by its long residence time in the body, resulting in extensive drug accumulation during treatment and long elimination half-lives. At the moment, different combination therapy strategies encompassing miltefosine are being tested in multiple controlled clinical trials in various geographical areas of endemicity, both in South Asia and East Africa. We here review the most salient pre-clinical and clinical pharmacological aspects of miltefosine, its mechanism of action against Leishmania parasites and other pathogens, and provide a systematic overview of the efficacy and safety data from all clinical trials of miltefosine, either alone or in combination, in the treatment of VL and CL.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a major public health problem in Bihar, accounting for 90\% of all cases in India. Development of high levels of resistance to various existing drugs necessitated the search for alternative orally administered drugs. Hospital-based studies have shown that oral miltefosine is a highly effective treatment for VL both in adults and in children.


METHODS

An open, single-arm trial was designed to investigate the feasibility of treatment of VL patients with miltefosine in field conditions in 13 centers in Bihar.


RESULTS

The phase 4 study was conducted among 1132 adult and pediatric VL patients. Compliance was good, with 1084 (95.5\%) patients completing the full 28-day treatment course. Nine hundred and seventy-one (85.8\%) patients returned for the final cure assessment at 6 months after treatment. The final cure rate was 82\% by intention to treat analysis and 95\% by per protocol analysis (similar to the 94\% cure rate in hospitalized patients). Treatment-related adverse events of common toxicity criteria grade 3 occurred in {\textasciitilde}3\% of patients, including gastrointestinal toxicity and rise in aspertate amino transferase, alanine amino transferase, or serum creatinine levels, similar to previous clinical experience.


CONCLUSION

This study supports the use of miltefosine in an outpatient setting in an area where VL is endemic.},

To compare the performance of three scaling models in predicting maintenance doses for children from those used in adults.
Three scaling models based on body weight (BW), body surface area (BSA) and BW were used to predict maintenance doses across the paediatric age band from the equivalent adult doses for 30 different drugs. The predicted doses were compared with those in the British National Formulary for children 2006 (BNFc). Percentage error and mean squared prediction error were used as a measure of precision, and mean prediction error was used as a measure of bias.
In the 1-month and 12-month age groups, the different approaches ranked on their bias (least bias first) were BWBW{\textgreater}BSA. The BSA and BW methods predicted doses up to 2.86-fold higher than the BNFc in the 1-month and 1-year age group. In the 7-year and 12-year age groups, BW and BSA performed better than BW for precision and bias, and no predictions were more than 1.8-fold higher than the BNFc. The BW method tended to also under-predict dose across the paediatric age range.
Dose scaling should only be used as a last resort for determining a suitable dose in children. No single method was suitable across the entire paediatric age range.},

A previously described cloned antigen, rK39, of Leishmania specific for all members of the L. donovani complex (L. chagasi, L. donovani, L. infantum) was very useful in the serodiagnosis by ELISA of both human and canine VL.

In patients infected with Schistosoma mansoni levels of IL-2R were higher in those with the hepatosplenic than in those with the intestinal form of the disease. Patients with malaria also showed increased serum levels of IL-2R, irrespective whether the infection was caused by Plasmodium falciparum or P. vivax.

There is no standard guideline for diagnosis and treatment for PKDL. A species-specific PCR on slit skin smear demonstrated a sensitivity of 93.8\%, but it has not been applied for routine diagnostic purpose. The study was conducted to determine the actual disease burden in an endemic area of Malda district, West Bengal, comparison of the three diagnostic tools for PKDL case detection and pattern of lesion regression after treatment. The prevalence of PKDL was determined by active surveillance and confirmed by PCR based diagnosis. Patients were treated with either sodium stibogluconate (SSG) or oral miltefosine and followed up for two years to observe lesion regression period. Twenty six PKDL cases were detected with a prevalence rate of 27.5\% among the antileishmanial antibody positive cases. Among three diagnostic methods used, PCR is highly sensitive (88.46\%) for case confirmation. In majority of the cases skin lesions persisted after treatment completion which gradually disappeared during 6-12 months post treatment period. Reappearance of lesions noted in two cases after 1.5 years of miltefosine treatment. A significant number of PKDL patients would remain undiagnosed without active mass surveys. Such surveys are required in other endemic areas to attain the ultimate goal of eliminating Kala-azar. PCR-based method is helpful in confirming diagnosis of PKDL, referral laboratory at district or state level can achieve it. So a well-designed study with higher number of samples is essential to establish when/whether PKDL patients are free from parasite after treatment and to determine which PKDL patients need treatment for longer period.},

METHODS: Standard treatment (1 mg/kg amphotericin B infusion on alternate days for 30 days, total dose 15 mg/kg) was compared with three drug combinations (single injection of 5 mg/kg liposomal amphotericin B and 7-day 50 mg oral miltefosine or single 10-day 11 mg/kg intramuscular paromomycin; or 10 days each of miltefosine and paromomycin) in an open-label, parallel-group, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial in two hospital sites in Bihar, India. Patients aged 5-60 years with parasitologically confirmed visceral leishmaniasis were randomly assigned one of the four treatments by the trial statistician by use of a computer-generated list. Clinical assessments were done at the end of treatment (15 days on combination treatment; 31 days for standard treatment) and after 45 days and 6 months. The primary endpoint was definitive cure (defined as no sign or symptom of visceral leishmaniasis and parasitologically cured to the last follow-up). Analyses were done both by intention to treat and per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00696969.
FINDINGS: Between June, 2008, and July, 2009, 634 patients were assigned amphotericin B (n=157), liposomal amphotericin B with miltefosine (n=160) or paromomycin (n=158), or miltefosine and paromomycin (n=159). 618 patients were in the per-protocol population. There were two relapses in each group. The numbers with definitive cure at 6 months for the intention-to-treat population were 146 (cure rate 93·0\%; CI 87·5-96·3) for amphotericin B, 156 (97·5\%; 93·3-99·2) for liposomal amphotericin B and miltefosine, 154 (97·5\%; 93·24-99·2) for liposomal amphotericin B and paromomycin, and 157 (98·7\%; 95·1-99·8) for miltefosine and paromomycin. All combinations were non-inferior to the standard treatment, in both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. Patients in the combination groups had fewer adverse events than did those assigned standard treatment.
INTERPRETATION: Combination treatments for visceral leishmaniasis are efficacious and safe, and decrease the duration of therapy, thereby encouraging adherence and reducing emergence of drug-resistant parasites.

We consider whether or not continuous culture devices are a way to obtain these measures. Staphylococcus aureus PS80 in high-density continuous cultures were exposed to oxacillin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, gentamicin, daptomycin and linezolid. Contrary to results from low density retentostats as well as to predictions of traditional PK/MIC ratios, daily dosing with up to 100× MIC did not clear these cultures. The densities of S. aureus in these cultures oscillated with constant amplitude and never fell below 10(5) CFU per ml. Save for daptomycin "treated" populations, the densities of bacteria in these cultures remained significantly below that of similar antibiotic-free cultures. Although these antibiotics varied in their pharmacodynamic properties there were only modest differences in their mean densities. Mathematical models and experiments suggest that the dominant factor preventing clearance was wall-adhering subpopulations reseeding the planktonic population which can be estimated and corrected for. Continuous cultures provide a way to evaluate the potential efficacy of antibiotic treatment regimes in vitro under conditions that are more clinically realistic and comprehensive than traditional in vitro PK/PD indices.},

Aerobic glycolysis is an inefficient way to generate adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), however, and the advantage it confers to cancer cells has been unclear. Here we propose that the metabolism of cancer cells, and indeed all proliferating cells, is adapted to facilitate the uptake and incorporation of nutrients into the biomass (e.g., nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids) needed to produce a new cell. Supporting this idea are recent studies showing that (i) several signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation also regulate metabolic pathways that incorporate nutrients into biomass; and that (ii) certain cancer-associated mutations enable cancer cells to acquire and metabolize nutrients in a manner conducive to proliferation rather than efficient ATP production. A better understanding of the mechanistic links between cellular metabolism and growth control may ultimately lead to better treatments for human cancer.},

Real-time PCR was used to measure parasitic load in tissue lesions of CL patients at the pretreatment (n=26) and at the post-treatment stage (n=10). Leishmania tropica was detected in all CL lesions with a mean value of 118 357 parasites g(-1) of dermal tissue. Following treatment, only one out of 10 patients showed residual parasites (100 parasites g(-1) tissue). Parasite load was high (mean, 306 000 parasites g(-1) tissue) in acute infections (early lesions) and low (mean, 1081 parasites g(-1) tissue) in chronic infections (late lesions). Intralesional transcripts of interferon-gamma, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-8, IL-10 and IL-4 were investigated in early lesions ({\textless}or=2 months, n=14) and late lesions ({\textgreater}2 months, n=15) by reverse transcriptase-PCR, where IL-4 was found to be significantly upregulated in early lesions (P{\textless}0.02). Further, the levels of parasite burden and IL-4 were distinctly correlated in various clinical forms of CL. Other cytokines were at comparable levels in early/late lesions and in different clinical forms. Upregulation of IL-4 was correlated with a higher parasite burden in early lesions of CL, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of CL by inhibiting a protective immune response.},

We provide an overview of the various guidelines concerning HAT and leishmaniasis over the past decades and show the confusion in the calculation of the dosage of pentamidine in these guidelines and the subsequent published reports on clinical trials and reviews. At present, only pentamidine isethionate is available, but the advised dosage for HAT and leishmaniasis is (historically) based on the amount of pentamidine base. In the treatment of leishmaniasis this is probably resulting in a subtherapeutic treatment. There is thus a need for a new, more transparent and concise guideline concerning the dosage of pentamidine, at least in the treatment of HAT and leishmaniasis.},

We applied dexamethasone (0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg/day) intragastrically in rats with acetic acid-induced gastric ulcer. The mucosal prostaglandin E(2) level and protein expressions of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at the ulcer margin were determined. Ulcer induction significantly increased protein expressions of bFGF, VEGF, and prostaglandin E(2) level at the ulcer margin together with angiogenesis at the ulcer margin and base. The non-ulcerogenic doses of dexamethasone inhibited angiogenesis at the ulcer margin and ulcer base and delayed ulcer healing. These were associated with a significant decrease of prostaglandin E(2) level and VEGF expression, but not the bFGF expression. Supplementation with prostaglandin E(2) attenuated the inhibitory action of dexamethasone on VEGF expression and reversed the adverse effects of dexamethasone on angiogenesis and ulcer healing, without influencing bFGF expression. We concluded that dexamethasone given at non-ulcerogenic doses could decrease angiogenesis and delay acetic acid-induced ulcer healing; these actions were at least, in part, due to depletion of prostaglandin E(2) level followed by down-regulation of VEGF at the ulcer margin of the stomach.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

A recent study has shown that treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) with the standard dose of 15 mg/kg/day of paromomycin sulphate (PM) for 21 days was not efficacious in patients in Sudan. We therefore decided to test the efficacy of paramomycin for a longer treatment duration (15 mg/kg/day for 28 days) and at the higher dose of 20 mg/kg/day for 21 days.


METHODS

This randomized, open-label, dose-finding, phase II study assessed the two above high-dose PM treatment regimens. Patients with clinical features and positive bone-marrow aspirates for VL were enrolled. All patients received their assigned courses of PM intramuscularly and adverse events were monitored. Parasite clearance in bone-marrow aspirates was tested by microscopy at end of treatment (EOT, primary efficacy endpoint), 3 months (in patients who were not clinically well) and 6 months after EOT (secondary efficacy endpoint). Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from a subset of patients weighing over 30 kg.


FINDINGS

42 patients (21 per group) aged between 4 and 60 years were enrolled. At EOT, 85\% of patients (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 63.7\% to 97.0\%) in the 20 mg/kg/day group and 90\% of patients (95\% CI: 69.6\% to 98.8\%) in the 15 mg/kg/day group had parasite clearance. Six months after treatment, efficacy was 80.0\% (95\% CI: 56.3\% to 94.3\%) and 81.0\% (95\% CI: 58.1\% to 94.6\%) in the 20 mg/kg/day and 15 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. There were no serious adverse events. Pharmacokinetic profiles suggested a difference between the two doses, although numbers of patients recruited were too few to make it significant (n = 3 and n = 6 in the 20 mg/kg/day and 15 mg/kg/day groups, respectively).


CONCLUSION

Data suggest that both high dose regimens were more efficacious than the standard 15 mg/kg/day PM for 21 days and could be further evaluated in phase III studies in East Africa.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy as well as the reproducibility of the urine latex agglutination test 'KAtex' in the diagnosis of kala-azar in patients recruited at a tertiary care centre in Dharan, Nepal, between November 2000 and January 2002.


METHODS

All patients presenting with fever of 2 weeks or more and splenomegaly were consecutively enrolled. Bone marrow and--if negative--spleen aspirates were examined for Leishmania donovani. Serum and urine samples were taken in duplicate for the Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) and KAtex. The reference laboratory determined sensitivity and specificity of KAtex. Reproducibility between both laboratories was assessed.


RESULTS

KAtex was performed on urine from 155 parasitologically confirmed kala-azar and 77 non-kala-azar cases (parasitology and DAT-negative). KAtex showed a sensitivity of 47.7\% (74/155, 95\% CI: 39.7-55.9) and a specificity of 98.7\% (76/77, 95\% CI: 93.0-100.0). Reproducibility of KAtex showed a kappa of 0.684 (P {\textless} 0.001, n = 232).


CONCLUSION

KAtex evaluation showed high specificity, low sensitivity and moderate reproducibility. A urine test for kala-azar could become a real breakthrough in kala-azar management if its reproducibility and sensitivity could be further improved.},

	abstract = {A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PB-PK) model was developed to describe trichloroethylene (TCE) kinetics in the pregnant rat exposed to TCE by inhalation, by bolus gavage, or by oral ingestion in drinking water. The kinetics of trichloroacetic acid (TCA), an oxidative metabolite of TCE, were described by a classical one-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Among the required model parameters for TCE, partition coefficients (PCs) and kinetic constants for oxidation were determined by vial equilibration and gas uptake methods, respectively. The fat: blood PC was 33.9; the blood:air PC was 13.2; and the fetal tissue:fetal blood PC was 0.51. TCE was readily metabolized with high substrate affinity. In naive and pregnant female rats the maximum velocities of oxidative metabolism were 10.98 ± 0.155 and 9.18 ± 0.078 mg/kg/hr, while the estimated Michaelis constant for the two groups of rats was very low, 0.25 mg/liter. The first-order rate constant for oral absorption of TCE from water was 5.4 ± 0.42/hr−1 in naive rats. With TCA, the volume of distribution (0.618 liter/kg) and the plasma elimination rate constant (0.045 ± 0.0024/hour) were estimated both from intravenous dosing studies with TCA and from an inhalation study with TCE. By comparison of the two routes of administration, the stoichiometric yield of TCA from TCE was estimated to be 0.12 in pregnant rats. To develop a data base for testing the fidelity of the PB-PK model, inhalation and bolus gavage exposures were conducted from Day 3 to Day 21 of pregnancy and a drinking water exposure from Day 3 to Day 22 of pregnancy. Inhalation exposures with TCE vapor were 4 hr/day at 618 ppm. The TCE concentration in drinking water was 350 μg/ml and the gavaged rats received single daily doses of 2.3 mg TCE/kg. Time varying physiological parameters for compartment volumes and blood flows during pregnancy were obtained from the published literature. Using the kinetic parameters determined by experimentation, TCE concentrations in maternal and fetal blood and TCA concentrations in maternal and fetal plasma were predicted from the PB-PK model by computer simulation and compared favorably with limited data obtained at restricted time points during pregnancy for all three routes of exposure. On the basis of the PB-PK model, fetal exposure to TCE, as area-under-the-curve, ranged from 67 to 76\% of maternal exposure. For TCA the fetal exposure was 63 to 64\% of the maternal exposure. The fetus is clearly at risk both to parent TCE and its TCA metabolite. With further validation, PB-PK modeling of expected fetal exposure should prove helpful in the design and interpretation of teratology and reproductive toxicology studies with a variety of volatile chemicals.},

	abstract = {Background
Genetic polymorphisms in the complex gene cluster encoding human Fc-gamma receptors (FcγRs) may influence malaria susceptibility and pathogenesis. Studying genetic susceptibility to malaria is ideal among sympatric populations because the distribution of polymorphic genes among such populations can help in the identification malaria candidate genes. This study determined the distribution of three FcyRs single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (FcγRIIB-rs1050519, FcγRIIC-rs3933769 and FcγRIIIA-rs396991) among sympatric Fulani and Dogon children with uncomplicated malaria. The association of these SNPs with clinical, malariometric and immunological indices was also tested.

Methods
This study involved 242 Fulani and Dogon volunteers from Mali age under 15 years. All SNPs were genotyped with predesigned TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assays. Genotypic and allelic distribution of SNPs was compared across ethnic groups using the Fisher exact test. Variations in clinical, malariometric and immunologic indices between groups were tested with Kruskal–Wallis H, Mann–Whitney U test and Fisher exact test where appropriate.

Results
The study confirmed known malariometric and immunologic differences between sympatric Fulani and non-Fulani tribes. Parasite density was lower in the Fulani than the Dogon (p {\textless} 0.0001). The mutant allele of FcγRIIC (rs3933769) was found more frequently in the Fulani than the Dogon (p {\textless} 0.0001) while that of FcγRIIIA (rs396991) occurred less frequently in the Fulani than Dogon (p = 0.0043). The difference in the mutant allele frequency of FcγRIIB (rs1050519) between the two ethnic groups was however not statistically significant (p = 0.064). The mutant allele of rs396991 was associated with high malaria-specific IgG1 and IgG3 in the entire study population and Dogon tribe, p = 0.023 and 0.015, respectively. Parasite burden was lower in carriers of the FcγRIIC (rs3933769) mutant allele than non-carriers in the entire study population (p {\textless} 0.0001). Carriers of this allele harboured less than half the parasites found in non-carriers.

Conclusion
Differences in the allelic frequencies of rs3933769 and rs396991 among Fulani and Dogon indirectly suggest that these SNPs may influence malaria susceptibility and pathogenesis in the study population. The high frequency of the FcγRIIC (rs3933769) mutant allele in the Fulani and its subsequent association with low parasite burden in the entire study population is noteworthy.},

APLs have essentially one long hydrocarbon chain that allows easy partitioning into membrane lipid bilayers, but they resist catabolic degradation. APLs therefore accumulate in cell membranes and can interfere with normal lipid metabolism and lipid-dependent signal transduction. This action, often leading to apoptosis, is most effective in metabolically active, proliferating cells, such as cancer cells, but not in quiescent normal cells. This review describes the general mechanisms of APL cellular uptake and action. Most important for their biological effect are the inhibition of phosphatidylcholine synthesis, the inhibition of the MAPkinase/ ERK proliferative and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/ Akt survival pathways and the stimulation of the Stressactivated protein kinase/JNK pathway, which may lead to apoptosis in cancer cells. APLs are most promising in combination with conventional cancer therapies. For example, ALPs increase the cancer cell sensitivity to radiotherapy in vitro and in vivo. We highlight the clinical potential of perifosine, an orally available APL.},

         A misunderstanding appears to exist regarding the appropriate method for allometric dose translations, especially when starting
         new animal or clinical studies. The need for education regarding appropriate translation is evident from the media response
         regarding some recent studies where authors have shown that resveratrol, a compound found in grapes and red wine, improves
         the health and life span of mice. Immediately after the online publication of these papers, the scientific community and popular
         press voiced concerns regarding the relevance of the dose of resveratrol used by the authors. The animal dose should not be
         extrapolated to a human equivalent dose (HED) by a simple conversion based on body weight, as was reported. For the more appropriate
         conversion of drug doses from animal studies to human studies, we suggest using the body surface area (BSA) normalization
         method. BSA correlates well across several mammalian species with several parameters of biology, including oxygen utilization,
         caloric expenditure, basal metabolism, blood volume, circulating plasma proteins, and renal function. We advocate the use
         of BSA as a factor when converting a dose for translation from animals to humans, especially for phase I and phase II clinical

MIL-R was easily induced in both strains using the promastigote-stage, but a significant increase in MIL-R in the intracellular amastigote compared to the corresponding WT did not occur until promastigotes had adapted to 12.2 µM MIL. A variety of common and strain-specific genetic changes were discovered in MIL-adapted parasites, including deletions at the LdMT transporter gene, single-base mutations and changes in somy. The most obvious lipid changes in MIL-R promastigotes occurred to phosphatidylcholines and lysophosphatidylcholines and results indicate that the Kennedy pathway is involved in MIL resistance. The inherent Sb resistance of the parasite had an impact on the changes that occurred in MIL-R parasites, with more genetic changes occurring in Sb-R compared to Sb-S parasites. Initial interpretation of the changes identified in this study does not support synergies with Sb-R in the mechanisms of MIL resistance, though this requires an enhanced understanding of the parasite's biochemical pathways and how they are genetically regulated to be verified fully.

	abstract = {Only anecdotal data are available on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of miltefosine in children suffering from visceral leishmaniasis (VL). While failure rates were higher in children with VL, steady-state concentrations appeared lower than those seen with adults. We hypothesized that the current linear dosage (in milligrams per kilogram of body weight) is too low for children and that a new dosing algorithm based on an appropriate body size model would result in an optimal exposure. A population PK analysis was performed on three historic pooled data sets, including Indian children, Indian adults, and European adults. Linear and allometric scaling of PK parameters by either body weight or fat-free mass (FFM) was evaluated for body size models. Based on the developed PK model, a dosing algorithm for miltefosine in children and adults was proposed and evaluated in silico. The population PK model employing allometric scaling fitted best to the pooled miltefosine data. Allometric scaling by FFM reduced between-subject variability, e.g., for drug clearance, from 49.6\% to 32.1\%. A new allometric miltefosine dosing algorithm was proposed. Exposure to miltefosine was lower in children than adults receiving 2.5 mg/kg/day: a C(max) of 18.8 μg/ml was reached by 90\% of adults and 66.7\% of children. The allometric daily dose resulted in similar levels of exposure to miltefosine for adults and children. The use of a new allometric dosing algorithm for miltefosine in VL patients results in optimal exposure to miltefosine in both adults and children and might improve clinical outcome in children.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the teratogenicity of isotretinoin in regard to aspects of species variation, toxicokinetics, and metabolism. Particular emphasis is given to the hypothesis that most effects of isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) are mediated by isomerization to the all-trans-retinoic acid. This mechanism of action would provide a basis for the understanding of species differences and the extrapolation of experimental results to the human situation and thus improve drug development. The insensitive species (rat, mouse) eliminate the drug rapidly through detoxification to the β-glucuronide; also, placental transfer is limited in these species. On the other hand, in sensitive species (primates), the drug is predominantly metabolized to the active 13-cis-4-oxo-retinoic acid; placental transfer is more extensive here. The β-glucuronides showed limited placental transfer in all species examined; these metabolites exhibited very low, if any, measurable concentrations in the human. The 13-cis-retinoic acid is not appreciably bound to cellular retinoid-binding proteins or nuclear receptors and exhibits low tissue distribution and placental transfer. Its access to the nucleus may be extensive. Because of the long half life of 13-cis-retinoic acid, continuous isomerization results in significant area under the concentration-time curve levels of all-trans-retinoic acid in the mouse, monkey and the human; the all-trans-retinoic acid formed is extensively distributed across the placenta and may be an important factor that contributes to the teratogenic potency of 13-cis-retinoic acid. Isomerization cannot explain the teratogenic effects of 13-cis-retinoic acid in the rat and rabbit. It is concluded that the high teratogenic activity of isotretinoin in sensitive species (human, monkey) is related to slow elimination of the 13-cis-isomer, to metabolism to the 4-oxo-derivative, to increased placental transfer, to continuous isomerization and significant exposure of the target tissue to all-trans-retinoic acid; and to lack of binding to cytoplasmic retinoid binding proteins that could possibly result in ready access to the nucleus.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fludarabine is often used as an important drug in reduced toxicity conditioning regimens prior to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). As no definitive pharmacokinetic (PK) basis for HCT dosing for the wide age and weight range in HCT is available, linear body surface area (BSA)-based dosing is still used.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the population PK of fludarabine in HCT recipients of all ages.
METHODS: From 258 HCT recipients aged 0.3-74 years, 2605 samples were acquired on days 1 (42\%), 2 (17\%), 3 (4\%) and 4 (37\%) of conditioning. Herein, the circulating metabolite of fludarabine was quantified, and derived concentration-time data were used to build a population PK model using non-linear mixed-effects modelling.
RESULTS: Variability was extensive where area under the curve ranged from 10 to 66 mg h/L. A three-compartment model with first-order kinetics best described the data. Actual body weight (BW) with standard allometric scaling was found to be the best body-size descriptor for all PK parameters. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was included as a descriptor of renal function. Thus, clearance was differentiated into a non-renal (3.24 ± 20\% L/h/70 kg) and renal (eGFR × 0.782 ± 11\% L/h/70 kg) component. The typical volumes of distribution of the central (V1), peripheral (V2), and second peripheral (V3) compartments were 39 ± 8\%, 20 ± 11\%, and 50 ± 9\% L/70 kg respectively. Intercompartmental clearances between V1 and V2, and V1 and V3, were 8.6 ± 8\% and 3.8 ± 13\% L/h/70 kg, respectively.
CONCLUSION: BW and eGFR are important predictors of fludarabine PK. Therefore, current linear BSA-based dosing leads to highly variable exposure, which may lead to variable treatment outcome.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the development of new drugs for the treatment of leishmaniasis. This has spurred the need for pharmacodynamic markers to monitor and compare therapies specifically for visceral leishmaniasis, in which the primary recrudescence of parasites is a particularly long-term event that remains difficult to predict. We performed a systematic review of studies evaluating biomarkers in human patients with visceral, cutaneous, and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, which yielded a total of 170 studies in which 53 potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers were identified. In conclusion, the large majority of these biomarkers constituted universal indirect markers of activation and subsequent waning of cellular immunity and therefore lacked specificity. Macrophage-related markers demonstrate favorable sensitivity and times to normalcy, but more evidence is required to establish a link between these markers and clinical outcome. Most promising are the markers directly related to the parasite burden, but future effort should be focused on optimization of molecular or antigenic targets to increase the sensitivity of these markers. In general, future research should focus on the longitudinal evaluation of the pharmacodynamic biomarkers during treatment, with an emphasis on the correlation of studied biomarkers and clinical parameters.},

To evaluate the in vitro activity of anti-leishmanial drugs against intracellular Leishmania donovani amastigotes in different types of macrophages.


METHODS

Mouse peritoneal macrophages (PEMs), mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMPhi), human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (PBM Phi) and differentiated THP-1 cells were infected with L. donovani. Cultures were incubated with sodium stibogluconate, amphotericin B deoxycholate (Fungizone), miltefosine or paromomycin sulphate over six concentrations in 3-fold serial dilutions for 5 days. Analysis was based on percentage inhibition of infected macrophages and EC(50)/EC(90) values estimated using sigmoidal curve-fitting.


RESULTS

The rank order of drug activity was the same in the different macrophage populations: amphotericin B {\textgreater} miltefosine {\textgreater} sodium stibogluconate {\textgreater} paromomycin. However, significant (P {\textless} 0.05) differences were observed between populations. Amphotericin B was more active in PEMs and BMM Phi (EC(50) 0.02-0.06 microM) compared with PBM Phi and differentiated THP-1 cells (EC(50) 0.08-0.40 microM) and miltefosine was more active in PBM Phi (EC(50) 0.16-0.74 microM) compared with PEMs and BMM Phi (EC(50) 2.60-7.67 microM). Sodium stibogluconate displayed highest activity in PBM Phi (EC(50) 1.38-1.89 microg Sb(v)/mL), followed by PEMs (EC(50) 21.75-27.79 microg Sb(v)/mL) and BMM Phi and differentiated THP-1 cells (EC(50) 28.96-112.77 microg Sb(v)/mL). Paromomycin showed highest activity in PBM Phi (EC(50) 80.03-104.38 microM) and PEMs (EC(50) 75.42-201.63 microM).


CONCLUSIONS

In vitro activity of anti-leishmanial drugs is host cell dependent. This has implications for: (i) the evaluation of in vitro drug activity; (ii) the evaluation of drug susceptibility of clinical isolates; and (iii) the standardization of anti-leishmanial drug assays.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To investigate whether cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes are influenced by amphotericin B (Am-B) during the treatment of Candida oesophagitis in HIV-infected patients.

METHODS
Twelve HIV-infected, antiretroviral-naive patients (CDC/WHO stage C3) with Candida oesophagitits were enrolled into a prospective clinical trial. The patients were treated with Am-B (0.4 mg/kg body weight) for two weeks. At baseline and after Am-B therapy the clearance of antipyrine and its metabolites were investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography. In addition, the urinary excretion of 6-beta-hydroxycortisol and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids was assessed by means of a radioimmunoassay.

RESULTS
The following significant changes were observed after Am-B treatment (P \&lt; 0.01): increase of antipyrine half-life (12.4 h vs 16.8 h) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (27.9 mg min/ml vs 38.1 mg min/ml); decrease of the total body clearance (61.2 ml/min vs 43.7 ml/min); decrease of the renal clearance of antipyrine metabolites - norantipyrine (7.45 ml/min vs 5.31 ml/min), 4-hydroxyantipyrine (15.4 ml/min vs 10.3 ml/min), hydroxymethylantipyrine (4.31 ml/min vs 3.65 ml/min); decrease of urinary 6-beta-hydroxycortisol excretion (453 microg/24h vs 298 microg/24h) and the ratio of 6-beta-hydroycortisol to 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (8.8\% vs 6.4\%).

CONCLUSIONS
Our data indicate that Am-B therapy has an inhibitory effect on cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes in HIV-infected patients. These results are of particular significance for HIV-infected patients who are concomitantly treated with drugs that are predominantly metabolised in the liver. A careful drug monitoring system seems advisable, especially for proteinase inhibitor experienced HIV-1-infected subjects.},

We examined and characterized the pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in a group of patients with Old World (Leishmania major) cutaneous leishmaniasis. Miltefosine plasma concentrations were determined in samples taken during and up to 5 months after the end of treatment from 31 Dutch military personnel who contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and were treated with 150 mg miltefosine/day for 28 days. Samples were analyzed with a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 4 ng/ml. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed with nonlinear mixed-effect modeling, using NONMEM. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine could best be described by an open two-compartment disposition model, with a first elimination half-life of 7.05 days and a terminal elimination half-life of 30.9 days. The median concentration in the last week of treatment (days 22 to 28) was 30,800 ng/ml. The maximum duration of follow-up was 202 days after the start of treatment. All analyzed samples contained a concentration above the LLOQ. Miltefosine is eliminated from the body much slower than previously thought and is therefore still detectable in human plasma samples taken 5 to 6 months after the end of treatment. The presence of subtherapeutic miltefosine concentrations in the blood beyond 5 months after treatment might contribute to the selection of resistant parasites, and moreover, the measures for preventing the teratogenic risks of miltefosine treatment should be reconsidered.},

Enhanced systemic IL-6 production was found in sera from dogs with the active disease compared to healthy dogs (t-test, P{\textless}0.05). In contrast, TNF-alpha did not differ between the two groups studied. There was no correlation between IL-6 production and anti-leishmanial antibody titers in the sera.

Miltefosine (MF) is the first oral compound used in the chemotherapy against leishmaniasis. Since the mechanism of action of this drug and the targets of MF in Leishmania are unclear, we generated in a step-by-step manner Leishmania major promastigote mutants highly resistant to MF. Two of the mutants were submitted to a short-read whole genome sequencing for identifying potential genes associated with MF resistance.


METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS

Analysis of the genome assemblies revealed several independent point mutations in a P-type ATPase involved in phospholipid translocation. Mutations in two other proteins-pyridoxal kinase and α-adaptin like protein-were also observed in independent mutants. The role of these proteins in the MF resistance was evaluated by gene transfection and gene disruption and both the P-type ATPase and pyridoxal kinase were implicated in MF susceptibility. The study also highlighted that resistance can be highly heterogeneous at the population level with individual clones derived from this population differing both in terms of genotypes but also susceptibility phenotypes.


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE

Whole genome sequencing was used to pinpoint known and new resistance markers associated with MF resistance in the protozoan parasite Leishmania. The study also demonstrated the polyclonal nature of a resistant population with individual cells with varying susceptibilities and genotypes.},

	abstract = {Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) includes different clinical manifestations displaying diverse intensities of dermal inflammatory infiltrate. Diffuse CL (DCL) cases are hyporesponsive, and lesions show very few lymphocytes and a predominance of macrophages. In contrast, localized CL (LCL) cases are responsive to leishmanial antigen, and lesions exhibit granulocytes and mononuclear cell infiltration in the early phases, changing to a pattern with numerous lymphocytes and macrophages later in the lesion. Therefore, different chemokines may affect the predominance of cell infiltration in distinct clinical manifestations. In lesions from LCL patients, we examined by flow cytometry the presence of different chemokines and their receptors in T cells, and we verified a higher expression of CXCR3 in the early stages of LCL (less than 30 days of infection) and a higher expression of CCR4 in the late stages of disease (more than 60 days of infection). We also observed a higher frequency of T cells producing IL-10 in the late stage of LCL. Using immunohistochemistry, we observed a higher expression of CCL7, CCL17 in lesions from late LCL, as well as CCR4 suggesting a preferential recruitment of regulatory T cells in the late LCL. Comparing lesions from LCL and DCL patients, we observed a higher frequency of CCL7 in DCL lesions. These results point out the importance of the chemokines, defining the different types of cells recruited to the site of the infection, which could be related to the outcome of infection as well as the clinical form observed.},

We show that 3 genomic locations suffice to specifically detect the SSG-resistant parasites found only in patients experiencing SSG treatment failure.

	abstract = {Amphotericin B remains the standard of care for the treatment of invasive and disseminated fungal infections. Various lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B have been developed to improve its therapeutic index by decreasing toxicity. Previous bioanalytic methods using microbial inhibition or high-pressure liquid chromatography quantified total amphotericin B (free, plasma protein-bound, and lipid-complexed). Sensitivity of this method with a low limit of quantitation of 0.05 microg/mL was inadequate to determine free (unbound) amphotericin B. A sensitive LC/MS/MS method was developed to determine the total amphotericin B value in human plasma and other biologic matrices and the free amphotericin B concentration in plasma. For determination of total plasma amphotericin B concentrations, the sample was diluted and injected onto the LC/MS/MS. For total amphotericin B in other matrices and free amphotericin B in plasma, solid-phase extraction was used. Natamycin served as an internal standard. A PE Sciex API 3000 (Sciex; Concord, Ontario, Canada) was used to assess free amphotericin B in plasma ultrafiltrate determination and an API 3+ for the other matrices, with electrospray interfaced to a C18 analytic column. The low limit of quantitation was 1 ng/mL for ultrafiltrate. For total amphotericin B, the low limits were 2 microg/mL for plasma, 0.05 microg/mL for urine, and 0.4 microg/mL for fecal homogenate. The methods were validated to show the standard range linearity, sensitivity, selectivity, accuracy, precision, and stability of amphotericin B in the matrices tested.},

	abstract = {Only anecdotal data are available on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of miltefosine in children suffering from visceral leishmaniasis (VL). While failure rates were higher in children with VL, steady-state concentrations appeared lower than those seen with adults. We hypothesized that the current linear dosage (in milligrams per kilogram of body weight) is too low for children and that a new dosing algorithm based on an appropriate body size model would result in an optimal exposure. A population PK analysis was performed on three historic pooled data sets, including Indian children, Indian adults, and European adults. Linear and allometric scaling of PK parameters by either body weight or fat-free mass (FFM) was evaluated for body size models. Based on the developed PK model, a dosing algorithm for miltefosine in children and adults was proposed and evaluated in silico. The population PK model employing allometric scaling fitted best to the pooled miltefosine data. Allometric scaling by FFM reduced between-subject variability, e.g., for drug clearance, from 49.6\% to 32.1\%. A new allometric miltefosine dosing algorithm was proposed. Exposure to miltefosine was lower in children than adults receiving 2.5 mg/kg/day: a C(max) of 18.8 μg/ml was reached by 90\% of adults and 66.7\% of children. The allometric daily dose resulted in similar levels of exposure to miltefosine for adults and children. The use of a new allometric dosing algorithm for miltefosine in VL patients results in optimal exposure to miltefosine in both adults and children and might improve clinical outcome in children.},

	abstract = {The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index for the efficacy of linezolid is a 24-h area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC₂₄)/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio of ≥100. The main adverse event associated with administration of linezolid is thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to define PD thresholds that would minimise linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia and to perform a population PK analysis to identify factors influencing the pharmacokinetics of linezolid. Population PK analysis revealed that creatinine clearance (CLCr) significantly affected linezolid pharmacokinetics: the mean parameter estimate of drug clearance (CL; in L/h)=0.0258 × CLCr + 2.03. A strong correlation (r=0.970) was found between AUC₂₄ and trough plasma concentrations (Cmin) [AUC₂₄=18.2 × Cmin + 134.4]. The Cmin value for AUC₂₄=200 (in the case of MIC=2 μg/mL) was estimated to be 3.6 μg/mL. Regarding safety, Cmin was a significant predictor of thrombocytopenia during treatment, and its threshold to minimise linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia was 8.2 μg/mL. A Kaplan-Meier plot revealed that the median time from initiation of therapy to the development of thrombocytopenia was 15 days. Therefore, the target Cmin range was 3.6-8.2 μg/mL. The following formula to achieve a target Cmin in patients with different degrees of renal function was proposed based on these results: initial daily dose (mg/day)=CL × AUC₂₄=(0.0258 × CLCr + 2.03)×(18.2 × Cmin + 134.4). This recommended initial dosage and subsequent dosage adjustment for the target concentration range should avoid adverse events, thereby enabling effective linezolid-based therapies to be continued.},

	abstract = {Leishmaniasis represents a complex of diseases with an important clinical and epidemiological diversity. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is of higher priority than cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) as it is a fatal disease in the absence of treatment. Anthroponotic VL foci are of special concern as they are at the origin of frequent and deathly epidemics (e.g. Sudan). Leishmaniasis burden remains important: 88 countries, 350 million people at risk, 500,000 new cases of VL per year, 1-1.5 million for CL and DALYs: 2.4 millions. Most of the burden is concentrated on few countries which allows clear geographic priorities. Leishmaniasis is still an important public health problem due to not only environmental risk factors such as massive migrations, urbanisation, deforestation, new irrigation schemes, but also to individual risk factors: HIV, malnutrition, genetic, etc em leader Leishmaniasis is part of those diseases which still requires improved control tools. Consequently WHO/TDR research for leishmaniasis has been more and more focusing on the development of new tools such as diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines. The ongoing effort has already produced significant results. The newly available control tools should allow a scaling up of control activities in priority areas. In anthroponotic foci, the feasibility of getting a strong impact on mortality, morbidity and transmission, is high.},

Simultaneous PKPD analysis (SIM) is generally considered the reference method but may be computationally burdensome and time consuming. Evaluation of alternative approaches aims at speeding up the computation time and stabilizing the estimation of the models, while estimating the model parameters with good enough precision. The IPPSE method presented here uses the individual PK parameter estimates and their uncertainty (SE) to propagate the PK information to the PD estimation step, while the IPP method uses the individual PK parameters only and the PPP\&D method utilizes the PK data. Data sets (n = 200) with various study designs were simulated according to a one-compartment PK model and a direct Emax PD model. The study design of each dataset was randomly selected. The same PK and PD models were fitted to the simulated observations using the SIM, IPP, PPP\&D and IPPSE methods. The performances of the methods were compared with respect to estimation precision and bias, and computation time. Estimated precision and bias for the IPPSE method were similar to that of SIM and PPP\&D, while IPP had higher bias and imprecision. Compared with the SIM method, IPPSE saved more computation time (61\%) than PPP\&D (39\%), while IPP remained the fastest method (86\% run time saved). The IPPSE method is a promising alternative for PKPD analysis, combining the advantages of the SIM (higher precision and lower bias of parameter estimates) and the IPP (shorter run time) methods.},

Phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ), a member of the class I PI3Ks that is highly expressed by leukocytes, controls cell migration by initiating actin polymerization and cytoskeletal reorganization, which are processes also critical for phagocytosis. In this study, we demonstrate that class IB PI3K, PI3Kγ, plays a critical role in pathogenesis of chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. mexicana. Using the isoform-selective PI3Kγ inhibitor, AS-605240 and PI3Kγ gene-deficient mice, we show that selective blockade or deficiency of PI3Kγ significantly enhances resistance against L. mexicana that is associated with a significant suppression of parasite entry into phagocytes and reduction in recruitment of host phagocytes as well as regulatory T cells to the site of infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AS-605240 is as effective as the standard antileishmanial drug sodium stibogluconate in treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. mexicana. These findings reveal a unique role for PI3Kγ in Leishmania invasion and establishment of chronic infection, and demonstrate that therapeutic targeting of host pathways involved in establishment of infection may be a viable strategy for treating infections caused by obligate intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Infection and inflammation are known to cause wide variability in disposition of drugs through modulation of drug transporters. However, the effects of inhibition of multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are poorly understood in normal and inflamed conditions. We hypothesized that inflammation alters the pharmacokinetic parameters of ciprofloxacin; and Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic indices, such as ratio of peak plasma concentration to minimum inhibitory concentration (C max/MIC) and ratio of area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) of ciprofloxacin will be improved with the co-administration of a MRP4 inhibitor, dipyridamole, in inflammatory conditions.
METHODS: In this study, the role of MRP4 on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of ciprofloxacin was investigated by the co-administration of dipyridamole in rats with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation. The pharmacokinetic parameters for ciprofloxacin were calculated by non-compartmental approach. MIC of ciprofloxacin was determined using broth microdilution technique.
RESULTS: Induction of inflammation in rats resulted in marked reduction in C max and AUC; and an increase in the volume of distribution (V d/F) and clearance (Cl/F) of ciprofloxacin, compared to normal rats. Co-administration of dipyridamole with ciprofloxacin in inflamed rats resulted in a threefold increase in AUC, a twofold decrease in V d/F and a threefold decrease in Cl/F of ciprofloxacin with significantly prolonged half-life compared to inflamed rats who received ciprofloxacin alone. Co-administration of dipyridamole enhanced AUC/MIC values of ciprofloxacin in both normal and inflamed rats.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that MRP4 inhibition increases the systemic exposure of ciprofloxacin in both normal and inflammatory conditions.},

	abstract = {The pharmacokinetics of intracellular drugs have recently aroused new interest because monitoring a drug's behaviour near the site of action can enhance knowledge of its efficacy and toxicity. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) is particularly attractive for intracellular analytes. Very few papers deal precisely with special features encountered in intracellular drug assay or with how closely the assay matches the actual recommendations.Particular problems are encountered mainly because the analytes are located intracellularly. This mainly concerns the handling of biological media, including provision of blank samples using Ficoll gradient separation, cell counts, optimisation of cell lysis, sample extraction, plotting standard curves using either fmol/10(6) cells or fmol/ml of extract or fmol/sample, the matrix effect as a function of the number of cells, stability before and during cell separation, as well as in storage conditions using clinical samples, biological matrix replacement and interference by endogenous compounds.This paper describes a strategy for the full validation and routine use of an LC/MS/MS assay applied to the simultaneous intracellular determination of the triphosphorylated anabolites of didanosine (2',3'-dideoxyadenosine triphosphate or ddA-TP) and stavudine (2',3'-didehydro-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate or d4T-TP), two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors of HIV, in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), as a guide for further LC/MS/MS assay of intracellular drugs.},

	abstract = {Fosfomycin, a phosphonic class antibiotic with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, has been used outside the United States since the early 1970s for the treatment of a variety of infections. In the United States, an oral (tromethamine salt) formulation is used for uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Recently, there has been interest in the use of an intravenous solution (ZTI-01) for the treatment of a broad range of infections associated with multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this era of multidrug-resistant bacteria with few treatment options, it is critical to understand the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) determinants for fosfomycin efficacy. Since such data are limited, a one-compartment in vitro infection model was used to determine the PK-PD index associated with efficacy and the magnitude of this measure necessary for various levels of effect. One challenge isolate (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, for which the fosfomycin agar MIC is 0.5 mg/liter and the broth microdilution MIC is 1 mg/liter) was evaluated in the dose fractionation studies, and two additional clinical E. coli isolates were evaluated in the dose-ranging studies. Mutation frequency studies indicated the presence of an inherently fosfomycin resistant E. coli subpopulation (agar MIC = 32 to 64 mg/liter) within the standard starting inoculum of a susceptibility test. Due to the presence of this resistant subpopulation, we identified the percentage of the dosing interval that drug concentrations were above the inherent resistance inhibitory concentration found at baseline to be the PK-PD index associated with efficacy (r(2) = 0.777). The magnitudes of this PK-PD index associated with net bacterial stasis and 1- and 2-log10 CFU/ml reductions from baseline at 24 h were 11.9, 20.9, and 32.8, respectively. These data provide useful information for modernizing and optimizing ZTI-01 dosing regimens for further study.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To examine the association between chronic use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and risk of hip fracture.


DESIGN

Prospective cohort study.


SETTING

Nurses' Health Study, which originally recruited from the 11 most populous states in the US.


PARTICIPANTS

79,899 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study who provided data on the use of PPIs and other risk factors biennially since 2000 and were followed up to 1 June 2008.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE

Incident hip fracture


RESULTS

During 565,786 person years of follow-up, we documented 893 incident hip fractures. The absolute risk of hip fracture among regular users of PPIs was 2.02 events per 1000 person years, compared with 1.51 events per 1000 person years among non-users. Compared with non-users, the risk of hip fracture among women who regularly used PPIs for at least two years was 35\% higher (age adjusted hazard ratio 1.35 (95\% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.62)), with longer use associated with increasing risk (P(trend){\textless}0.01). Adjustment for risk factors, including body mass index, physical activity, and intake of calcium did not materially alter this association (hazard ratio 1.36 (1.13 to 1.63)). These associations were also not changed after accounting for reasons for PPI use. The relation between PPI use and fracture differed by smoking history (P(interaction)=0.03). Among current and former smokers, PPI use was associated with greater than 50\% increase in risk of fracture, with a multivariate hazard ratio for fracture of 1.51 (1.20 to 1.91). In contrast, among women who never smoked there was no association (multivariate hazard ratio 1.06 (0.77 to 1.46)). In a meta-analysis of these results with 10 prior studies, the pooled odds ratio of hip fracture associated with PPI use was 1.30 (1.25 to 1.36).


CONCLUSION

Chronic use of PPIs is associated with increased risk of hip fracture, particularly among women with a history of smoking.},

The glycolytic phenotype in cancer appears to be the common denominator of diverse molecular abnormalities in cancer and may be associated with a (potentially reversible) suppression of mitochondrial function. The generic drug dichloroacetate is an orally available small molecule that, by inhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, increases the flux of pyruvate into the mitochondria, promoting glucose oxidation over glycolysis. This reverses the suppressed mitochondrial apoptosis in cancer and results in suppression of tumour growth in vitro and in vivo. Here, we review the scientific and clinical rationale supporting the rapid translation of this promising metabolic modulator in early-phase cancer clinical trials.},

	abstract = {This study was a randomized, open label comparison that was designed to determine efficacy and safety of miltefosine as the first oral drug for the treatment of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major in comparison with meglumine antimoniate. Complete clinical response was defined as 100\% re-epithelialization of the lesion. Definitions of lesion cure and failure were based on both clinical and parasitological criteria two weeks after the end of treatment and clinical recovery three months after this period. Of 32 patients enrolled for miltefosine treatment 28 patients completed treatment, of which 26 were cured at three months, corresponding to a cure rate of 92.9\% on a per protocol analysis, and 81.3\% according to intention to treat analysis. There was one failure (3.1\%), one relapse (3.1\%) and four dropouts due to lack of tolerability (12.5\%) during the first week of treatment. Of 31 patients who received intramuscular meglumine antimoniate (20mgSb(5)/kg body weight daily for 14 days) 25 were cured (83.3\% on a per protocol basis, 80.6\% on intention to treat basis), five failed (16.1\%) and one was lost (3.2\%) at 3-month follow-up. At 6-month follow-up after the end of treatment, no relapse was observed. Both regimens were tolerated but averages of nausea (32.2\%) and vomiting (21.5\%) were observed in patients during two weeks after initiation of miltefosine treatment. Other gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and total adverse events were not statistically different in the two groups during one to four weeks after therapy initiation. No relevant changes were observed in levels of liver enzymes, creatinine and hematological tests before and after end of treatment in both groups. In conclusion, miltefosine is apparently at least as good as meglumine antimoniate for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. major in Iran, based on parasitological as well as clinical criteria two weeks, three months, and six months after end of treatment.},

	abstract = {Patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL)-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection experience increased drug toxicity and treatment failure rates compared to VL patients, with more frequent VL relapse and death. In the era of VL elimination strategies, HIV coinfection is progressively becoming a key challenge, because HIV-coinfected patients respond poorly to conventional VL treatment and play an important role in parasite transmission. With limited chemotherapeutic options and a paucity of novel anti-parasitic drugs, new interventions that target host immunity may offer an effective alternative. In this review, we first summarize current views on how VL immunopathology is significantly affected by HIV coinfection. We then review current clinical and promising preclinical immunomodulatory interventions in the field of VL and discuss how these may operate in the context of a concurrent HIV infection. Caveats are formulated as these interventions may unpredictably impact the delicate balance between boosting of beneficial VL-specific responses and deleterious immune activation/hyperinflammation, activation of latent provirus or increased HIV-susceptibility of target cells. Evidence is lacking to prioritize a target molecule and a more detailed account of the immunological status induced by the coinfection as well as surrogate markers of cure and protection are still required. We do, however, argue that virologically suppressed VL patients with a recovered immune system, in whom effective antiretroviral therapy alone is not able to restore protective immunity, can be considered a relevant target group for an immunomodulatory intervention. Finally, we provide perspectives on the translation of novel theories on synergistic immune cell cross-talk into an effective treatment strategy for VL-HIV-coinfected patients.},

Sixty patients, 30 children aged 2 to 12 years and 30 adults aged 18 to 60 years, were enrolled. Participants received miltefosine (Impavido) at a nominal dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days. Miltefosine concentrations were measured in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of samples obtained during treatment and up to 6 months following completion of treatment, when therapeutic outcome was determined. Fifty-two patients were cured, 5 pediatric patients failed treatment, and 3 participants were lost to follow-up. Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis predominated among the strains isolated (42/46; 91\%). Noncompartmental analysis demonstrated that plasma and intracellular miltefosine concentrations were, overall, lower in children than in adults. Exposure to miltefosine, estimated by area under the concentration-time curve and maximum concentration, was significantly lower in children in both the central and intracellular compartments (P {\textless} 0.01). Leishmania persistence was detected in 43\% of study participants at the end of treatment and in 27\% at 90 days after initiation of treatment. Clinical response was not dependent on parasite elimination. In vitro miltefosine susceptibility was similar for Leishmania strains from adults and children. Our results document PK differences for miltefosine in children and adults with cutaneous leishmaniasis that affect drug exposure and could influence the outcome of treatment, and they provide bases for optimizing therapeutic regimens for CL in pediatric populations.

Up to the year 2001, nearly 2,000 cases of coinfection were identified, of which 90\% were from Spain, Italy, France, and Portugal. However, these figures are misleading because they do not account for the large proportion of cases in many African and Asian countries that are missed due to a lack of diagnostic facilities and poor reporting systems. Most cases of coinfection in the Americas are reported in Brazil, where the incidence of leishmaniasis has spread in recent years due to overlap with major areas of HIV transmission. In some areas of Africa, the number of coinfection cases has increased dramatically due to social phenomena such as mass migration and wars. In northwest Ethiopia, up to 30\% of all visceral leishmaniasis patients are also infected with HIV. In Asia, coinfections are increasingly being reported in India, which also has the highest global burden of leishmaniasis and a high rate of resistance to antimonial drugs. Based on the previous experience of 20 years of coinfection in Europe, this review focuses on the management of Leishmania-HIV-coinfected patients in low-income countries where leishmaniasis is endemic.},

	abstract = {We previously reported that inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2 is required for the gastrointestinal ulcerogenic properties of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Inhibition of COX-1 up-regulates COX-2 expression, and the prostaglandins (PGs) produced by COX-2 help to maintain the mucosal integrity during inhibition of COX-1. In the present study we investigated whether dexamethasone damages rat gastrointestinal mucosa during inhibition of COX-1 and further developed the idea that COX-2 expression is a key event in the ulcerogenic actions of NSAIDs. Dexamethasone was given p.o. in the absence or presence of SC-560 (a selective COX-1 inhibitor), and the stomach or intestine was examined 8 or 24 hr later, respectively. Neither dexamethasone nor SC-560 alone damaged the gastrointestinal mucosa. In the presence of SC-560, however, dexamethasone damaged the stomach but not small intestine. SC-560 decreased PGE(2) levels in both tissues, with a gradual recovery accompanying the up-regulation of COX-2 expression, and both the recovery of PGE(2) levels and the expression of COX-2 were inhibited by dexamethasone. In the animals treated with SC-560, iNOS expression was up-regulated in the intestinal but not the gastric mucosa, and this response was also inhibited by dexamethasone. These results suggest a risk from steroid therapy in the stomach when COX-2 expression is up-regulated. Dexamethasone does not provoke damage in the intestine, despite inhibiting the up-regulation of COX-2 expression under conditions of PG deficiency; at least one of the reasons is that this agent prevents the expression of iNOS, a major factor in the pathogenesis of intestinal lesions.},

Ten large and mid-sized pharmaceutical companies provided responses to this survey. The results indicate that MBDD is achieving broad application in early and late development and is positively affecting both internal and regulatory decisions. Senior leadership (vice president and higher) within the companies indicated widely accepted utility for dose selection and gaining acceptance for study design and regulatory interactions but limited acceptance in discovery and commercial/pipeline decisions.

	abstract = {Background
Treatment options for Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in East Africa are far from satisfactory due to cost, toxicity, prolonged treatment duration or emergence of parasite resistance. Hence there is a need to explore alternative treatment protocols such as miltefosine alone or in combinations including miltefosine, sodium stibogluconate (SSG) or liposomal amphotericin B. The aim of this trial is to identify regimen(s) which are sufficiently promising for future trials in East Africa.

Methods/Design
A phase II randomized, parallel arm, open-labelled trial is being conducted to assess the efficacy of each of the three regimens: liposomal amphotericin B with SSG, Liposomal amphotericin B with miltefosine and miltefosine alone. The primary endpoint is cure at day 28 with secondary endpoint at day 210 (6 months). Initial cure is a single composite measure based on parasitologic evaluation (bone marrow, spleen or lymph node aspirate) and clinical assessment. Repeated interim analyses have been planned after recruitment of 15 patients in each arm with a maximum sample size of 63 for each. These will follow group-sequential methods (the triangular test) to identify when a regimen is inadequate ({\textless}75\% efficacy) or adequate ({\textgreater}90\% efficacy). We describe a method to ensure consistency of the sequential analysis of day 28 cure with the non-sequential analysis of day 210 cure.

Discussion
A regimen with adequate efficacy would be a candidate for treatment of VL with reasonable costs. The design allows repeated testing throughout the trial recruitment period while maintaining good statistical properties (Type I \& II error rates) and reducing the expected sample sizes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Leishmania infantum recently has been identified as a possible agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). This species has been isolated from cutaneous lesions of patients from the Mediterranean Basin. However, little is known about the clinical, biological, or therapeutic features of this newly recognized CL. OBSERVATIONS: Six patients aged 9 months to 85 years in southeastern France were found to have autochthonous leishmaniasis. Parasitological identification showed that the agent was L infantum, zymodemes Montpellier-1 for 2 patients and Montpellier-24 for 1 patient. Five patients who underwent testing with a Western blot assay were found to have antibodies against 4 antigens with molecular masses of 18, 21, 23, and 31 kd. Five patients were successfully treated with local injections of N-methylglucamine, and 1 patient was successfully treated with topical paromomycin sulfate. No patient had visceral disease at diagnosis or after follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Recent data provide increasing evidence that L infantum is an important agent of CL. In southwestern Europe, this species is the only agent that has long been identified from autochthonous CL. Leishmania infantum should be considered an agent of CL in areas in which visceral leishmaniasis is endemic. Western blot assay could be a useful test for the diagnosis, but precise parasitological identification is important to having a better knowledge of the disease. The relationships between CL and the visceral disease have to be explored.},

Fifty-six of 58 sera (96.5\%) from confirmed cases of visceral leishmaniasis, whose bone marrow aspirates contained Leishmania donovani amastigotes, had agglutinating antibodies above the cut-off titre of 1:800. None of the sera from healthy control subjects from non-endemic or endemic areas had anti-leishmanial antibodies. Similarly, none of the sera obtained from cases of malaria or tuberculosis had agglutinating antibodies above the cut-off titre. A significant decline in agglutinating antibody titre in 3 cases following antileishmanial chemotherapy appeared to correlate with regression of clinical symptoms and the absence of amastigotes from bone marrow aspirates. One of 3 cases developed post-kala-azar dermal lesions and sera from this subject had an elevated agglutinating antibody titre. It is concluded that the DAT is a sensitive and specific test to confirm visceral leishmaniasis. As the formalin-fixed promastigotes, stained with Coomassie blue, which are used as antigen could be stored at 4 degrees C for 6 months without any loss of ability to detect anti-leishmanial antibodies, the DAT is recommended for use under field conditions.},

	abstract = {The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in leishmaniasis patients are, to a great extent, unknown. We examined and characterized the pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in a group of patients with Old World (Leishmania major) cutaneous leishmaniasis. Miltefosine plasma concentrations were determined in samples taken during and up to 5 months after the end of treatment from 31 Dutch military personnel who contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and were treated with 150 mg miltefosine/day for 28 days. Samples were analyzed with a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 4 ng/ml. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed with nonlinear mixed-effect modeling, using NONMEM. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine could best be described by an open two-compartment disposition model, with a first elimination half-life of 7.05 days and a terminal elimination half-life of 30.9 days. The median concentration in the last week of treatment (days 22 to 28) was 30,800 ng/ml. The maximum duration of follow-up was 202 days after the start of treatment. All analyzed samples contained a concentration above the LLOQ. Miltefosine is eliminated from the body much slower than previously thought and is therefore still detectable in human plasma samples taken 5 to 6 months after the end of treatment. The presence of subtherapeutic miltefosine concentrations in the blood beyond 5 months after treatment might contribute to the selection of resistant parasites, and moreover, the measures for preventing the teratogenic risks of miltefosine treatment should be reconsidered.},

To assess the field accuracy, reproducibility and feasibility of the formol gel test (FGT), the urine latex agglutination test (KAtex) and a rK39 antigen-based dipstick for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in rural Nepal.


METHOD

Patients with clinical suspicion of VL were recruited at Rangeli District Hospital (DH), a 15-bed government hospital located in south-eastern Nepal. FGT, KAtex and rK39 dipstick tests were performed on site and later repeated at a reference kala-azar diagnostic laboratory to assess reproducibility. Diagnosis of VL was confirmed by either a positive bone marrow aspirate examination or a positive direct agglutination test (DAT titre {\textgreater} or = 1:3200) in patients who later responded to anti-leishmanial therapy.


RESULTS

Of 155 patients initially recruited, 142 (85 with VL and 57 with another diagnosis) were included in the study. The sensitivity of the rK39 dipstick [89\%; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 81-94] was significantly higher than that of the KAtex (57\%; 95\% CI: 46-67) and the FGT (52\%; 95\% CI: 41-62). All three tests had a specificity of at least 90\%. Agreement was higher for the rK39 dipstick (kappa = 0.87) than for the FGT (0.68) and the KAtex (0.43). All tests required {\textless} or = 20 min of actual work and {\textless} or = 40 min to obtain the results.


CONCLUSION

The rK39 dipstick was easy to do, more accurate and reproducible than other rapid diagnostic tests for VL in a DH of rural Nepal. It should be integrated into the field diagnostic algorithm of VL in this region and mechanisms to secure its availability should be found.},

Level of IgG4 was significantly elevated in PKDL compared to KA, although total IgG and IgG1 were significantly lower. The antileishmania antibody levels of subclass IgG3 and IgG4 were found significantly elevated in paediatrics, however, levels of IgG, IgG1, IgG2 and CRP were comparable in paediatric and adult KA cases. In case of PKDL, levels of IgG and it subclass were similar in the two groups. No significant difference in antileishmanial antibody level was noticed between macular or polymorphic cases of PKDL.

	abstract = {PsN-Toolkit is a collection of statistical tools for pharmacometric data analysis using the non-linear mixed effect modeling software NONMEM. The toolkit is object oriented and written in the programming language Perl using the programming library Perl-speaks-NONMEM (PsN). Five methods: the Bootstrap, the Jackknife, Log-likelihood Profiling, Case-deletion Diagnostics and Stepwise Covariate Model building are included as separate classes and may be used in user-written Perl scripts or through stand-alone command line applications. The tools are designed with the ability to cooperate and with an emphasis on common structures for workflow and result handling. Parallel execution of independent tool sections is supported on shared memory multiprocessor (SMP) computers, Mosix/openMosix clusters and distributed computing environments following the NorduGrid standard. In conclusion, PsN-Toolkit makes it easier to use the Bootstrap, the Jackknife, Log-likelihood Profiling, Case-deletion Diagnostics and Stepwise Covariate Model building in pharmacometric data analysis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lean bodyweight (LBW) has been recommended for scaling drug doses. However, the current methods for predicting LBW are inconsistent at extremes of size and could be misleading with respect to interpreting weight-based regimens.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to develop a semi-mechanistic model to predict fat-free mass (FFM) from subject characteristics in a population that includes extremes of size. FFM is considered to closely approximate LBW. There are several reference methods for assessing FFM, whereas there are no reference standards for LBW.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 373 patients (168 male, 205 female) were included in the study. These data arose from two populations. Population A (index dataset) contained anthropometric characteristics, FFM estimated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA - a reference method) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) data. Population B (test dataset) contained the same anthropometric measures and FFM data as population A, but excluded BIA data. The patients in population A had a wide range of age (18-82 years), bodyweight (40.7-216.5 kg) and BMI values (17.1-69.9 kg/m2). Patients in population B had BMI values of 18.7-38.4 kg/m2. A two-stage semi-mechanistic model to predict FFM was developed from the demographics from population A. For stage 1 a model was developed to predict impedance and for stage 2 a model that incorporated predicted impedance was used to predict FFM. These two models were combined to provide an overall model to predict FFM from patient characteristics. The developed model for FFM was externally evaluated by predicting into population B.
RESULTS: The semi-mechanistic model to predict impedance incorporated sex, height and bodyweight. The developed model provides a good predictor of impedance for both males and females (r2 = 0.78, mean error [ME] = 2.30 x 10(-3), root mean square error [RMSE] = 51.56 [approximately 10\% of mean]). The final model for FFM incorporated sex, height and bodyweight. The developed model for FFM provided good predictive performance for both males and females (r2 = 0.93, ME = -0.77, RMSE = 3.33 [approximately 6\% of mean]). In addition, the model accurately predicted the FFM of subjects in population B (r2 = 0.85, ME = -0.04, RMSE = 4.39 [approximately 7\% of mean]).
CONCLUSIONS: A semi-mechanistic model has been developed to predict FFM (and therefore LBW) from easily accessible patient characteristics. This model has been prospectively evaluated and shown to have good predictive performance.},

	abstract = {Ether lysophospholipids, 1-O-[1'-14C]octadec-1'-enyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (A) and -phosphocholine (B) as well as 1-O-[1'-14C]octadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (C) and -phosphocholine (D) were taken up rapidly and metabolized extensively in Leishmania donovani promastigotes. Degradation to neutral lipids occurred first, followed by incorporation into phospholipids. Incubation of the cells with (A) or (B) revealed the stability of the O-[1-14C]octadec-1-enyl group up to 15 h, indicating the absence of any O-alk-1-enyl cleavage enzymes. Most of the radioactivity was found in 1-O-alkenyl-2-acyl-glycerophosphoethanolamine and 1-O-alkenyl-2,3-diacylglycerol. 1-O-Alkenyl-2-acyl-glycerophosphocholine was detected only after incubation with substrate (B). In contrast to the O-alk-1-enyl residue, the O-[1-14C]octadecyl moiety in substrate (C) and (D) could be converted into the O-[1-14C]octadec-1-enyl moiety or cleaved, yielding labelled acyl groups. Following 5 h incubation with substrate (C), most of the incorporated radioactivity was associated with 1-O-[1'-14C]octadec-1'-enyl-2-acyl-glycerophosphoethanolamine, 1-O-[1'-14C]octadecyl-2,3-diacylglycerol and 1-O-[1'-14C]octadecyl-2-acyl-glycerophosphoinositol. After 15 h minor amounts of label appeared in diacyl glycerophosphocholine. Similar labelling patterns were obtained with the choline analogue (D), except that 1-O-[1'-14C]octadecyl-2-acyl-glycerophosphocholine was found additionally. Incubations of the four labelled ether lysophospholipids with cell homogenates showed the presence of a lysophospholipase D and a phosphohydrolase. There was no specificity towards different ether residues or phosphobase moieties. Formation of alkyl- and alkenylglycerol, respectively, was stimulated by Mg2+ ions and the phosphohydrolase was inhibited by NaF. The results support the conclusion that the specific pattern of ether phospholipids in L. donovani cells is due to a pronounced specificity of the biosynthetic enzymes. Enzymes of the catabolic reactions are of low specificity or absent, such as plasmalogenases.},

Symptomatic disease is subacute or chronic and diverse in presentation and outcome. Clinical characteristics vary further by endemic region. Despite T-cell-dependent immune responses, which produce asymptomatic and self-healing infection, or appropriate treatment, intracellular infection is probably life-long since targeted cells (tissue macrophages) allow residual parasites to persist. There is an epidemic of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and Pakistan and of visceral infection in India and Sudan. Diagnosis relies on visualising parasites in tissue or serology; culture and detection of parasite DNA are useful in the laboratory. Pentavalent antimony is the conventional treatment; however, resistance of visceral infection in India has spawned new treatment approaches--amphotericin B and its lipid formulations, injectable paromomycin, and oral miltefosine. Despite tangible advances in diagnosis, treatment, and basic scientific research, leishmaniasis is embedded in poverty and neglected. Current obstacles to realistic prevention and proper management include inadequate vector (sandfly) control, no vaccine, and insufficient access to or impetus for developing affordable new drugs.},

Five months later he developed clinical PKDL, with extensive cutaneous, conjunctival and oral mucosal involvement.

He too was subsequently found to be seropositive for HIV and was treated with stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine from May 2004. He developed a nodular rash of PKDL over his face and upper body 2 weeks after starting the antiretroviral therapy. Treatment of both patients with oral miltefosine, at 100 mg/day for 28 days, led to the complete regression of their PKDL lesions.

	abstract = {In the search for new approaches to cancer therapy, the first alkyllysophospholipid (ALP) analogs were designed and studied about two decades ago, either as potential immunomodulators or as antimetabolites of phospholipid metabolism. In the meantime, it has been demonstrated that they really act in this way. However, their special importance is based on the fact that, in addition, they interfere with key events of signal transduction, such as hormone (or cytokine)-receptor binding or processing, protein kinase C or phospholipase C function and phosphatidylinositol and calcium metabolism. There are no strict structural requirements for their activity. Differences in the cellular uptake or the state of cellular differentiation seem to be mainly responsible for higher or lower sensitivities of cells towards ALP analogs. Consequences of the molecular effects mentioned on the cellular level are cytostasis, induction of differentiation (while in contrast the effects of known inducers of differentiation such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate are inhibited, probably as a consequence of protein kinase C inhibition) and loss of invasive properties. Already in sublytic concentrations, alterations in the membrane structure were observed, and lysis may begin at concentrations not much higher than those causing the other effects described. Few ALP analogs have already entered clinical studies or are in clinical use. ALP analogs are the only antineoplastic agents that do not act directly on the formation and function of the cellular replication machinery. Therefore, their effects are independent of the proliferative state of the target cells. Because of their interference with cellular regulatory events, including those failing in cancer cells, ALP analogs, beyond their clinical importance, are interesting model compounds for the development of new, more selective drugs for cancer therapy.},

FTIR spectroscopy is well proven for characterizing aspects of weak interactions, above all hydrogen bonding. We have used this method to study solid deposits of a number of selected lipid models, such as choline, acetylcholine and methylphosphocholine (MePC), and compared them with the common phospholipid dimyristoylglycerophosphocholine (DMPC), at different degrees of hydration, which were varied via relative humidity (RH).
At low RHs, only MePC and DMPC take up considerable amounts of water, thus elucidating the essential role of phosphate groups in the first stages of lipid hydration. The progress of PC-headgroup hydration can be sensitively monitored by the wavenumber decrease of the band owing to antisymmetric PO2- stretching vibration. Concomitant variations of the spectral parameters of [nu]CH bands of MePC reveal that conformational changes may simultaneously occur in the headgroup. Surprisingly to us, the model compounds display qualitative differences in the appearance of their [nu]CH bands, which are most probably a result of substituent effects.},

	abstract = {Despite increases in the incidence of many parasitic infections in recent years, the number of studies designed to improve the treatment of these infections has failed to keep pace with their huge impact on public health. Unfortunately, research and development in this field is not an economically attractive proposition for the pharmaceutical industry, and this neglect is exacerbated by the fact that many parasitic diseases have negligible profiles in countries that have the funds to research them. An absence of effective vaccines means that, for the foreseeable future, chemotherapy is likely to be the mainstay of disease management. This review describes the advances gained in our understanding of the relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, with the aim of improving the way in which we use antiparasitic agents while at the same time highlighting those areas where there is an urgent need for further investigation. Unsurprisingly, much of our success has been in the chemotherapy of malaria, where the link between drug concentration and response is reasonably well characterised. For many other diseases, however, this link is poorly understood, in some cases because the mechanism of action of the drug has not been fully elucidated, or in other cases because a true pharmacodynamic endpoint may be unavailable. Overcoming these problems is critical if the clinician is to have the information necessary to enable optimal treatment of patients who may be severely ill and in need of immediate, life-saving attention.},

	abstract = {The fact that metabolic rate scales as the three-quarter power of body mass (M) in unicellular, as well as multicellular, organisms suggests that the same principles of biological design operate at multiple levels of organization. We use the framework of a general model of fractal-like distribution networks together with data on energy transformation in mammals to analyze and predict allometric scaling of aerobic metabolism over a remarkable 27 orders of magnitude in mass encompassing four levels of organization: individual organisms, single cells, intact mitochondria, and enzyme molecules. We show that, whereas rates of cellular metabolism in vivo scale as M(-1/4), rates for cells in culture converge to a single predicted value for all mammals regardless of size. Furthermore, a single three-quarter power allometric scaling law characterizes the basal metabolic rates of isolated mammalian cells, mitochondria, and molecules of the respiratory complex; this overlaps with and is indistinguishable from the scaling relationship for unicellular organisms. This observation suggests that aerobic energy transformation at all levels of biological organization is limited by the transport of materials through hierarchical fractal-like networks with the properties specified by the model. We show how the mass of the smallest mammal can be calculated (approximately 1 g), and the observed numbers and densities of mitochondria and respiratory complexes in mammalian cells can be understood. Extending theoretical and empirical analyses of scaling to suborganismal levels potentially has important implications for cellular structure and function as well as for the metabolic basis of aging.},

	doi = {10.1093/jac/dkw089},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the pharmacokinetic properties of oleylphosphocholine (OlPC) in hamsters following a single oral dose. Its prophylactic activity was tested to establish exposure-activity relationships, while a 5 + 5 day oral regimen at 20 mg/kg with long post-treatment follow-up was performed to assess its curative potential.
METHODS: Single oral doses of 20, 50 and 100 mg/kg were administered for pharmacokinetic analysis while a 100 mg/kg single oral dose was given on day 7, 4 or 1, or 4 h prior to infection in the prophylactic efficacy study. The animals were infected on day 0 with Leishmania infantum and the resulting parasite burdens were measured in target organs on day 21. In the curative model, treatment started on day 21 post-infection at 20 mg/kg for 5 + 5 days and amastigote burdens were determined in target organs either on day 42 [10 days after the end of treatment (dpt)] or day 72 (40 dpt).
RESULTS: OlPC showed elimination t1/2 of ∼50 h and dose-proportional exposure. The prophylactic action of OlPC was in agreement with model-simulated drug exposures, showing dose-dependent residual activity. Interestingly, the 100 mg/kg single dose administered 4 days before infection (day -4) still reduced the overall parasite burden by ∼50\%. In the curative model, {\textgreater}99\% clearance of infection was observed at 10 dpt in all OlPC-treated animals and remained so at 40 dpt.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that total plasma exposure (AUCt-∞) correlates well with the prophylactic and curative efficacy of OlPC in the L. infantum hamster model.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9509175},
	abstract = {Two hundred and seventy patients with febrile splenomegaly and coming from areas where visceral leishmaniasis (VL; kala-azar) is endemic and in whom the diagnosis of kala-azar was strongly suspected were randomly divided into 3 groups, subjected to splenic aspiration by the intercostal route, splenic aspiration by the abdominal route, and bone marrow aspiration, respectively, for demonstration of amastigotes. Pain immediately after aspiration, requiring a few analgesic tablets, occurred in 8, 16 and 20 patients of the 3 groups, respectively. Pain on the day after aspiration was reported by 2, 4 and 6 patients, respectively. One patient, in the abdominal group, developed gastro-intestinal haemorrhage but this was managed with blood transfusion; he was not suffering from VL. No patient died. The abdominal route of splenic aspiration was not feasible in 12 patients (13\%), as their spleen size was less than 3 cm, and they were subsequently aspirated by the intercostal route. On the first aspiration, amastigotes were seen in 68 patients (76\%) in the intercostal group, 64 patients (71\%) in the abdominal group and 42 patients (46\%) in the bone marrow group. Two weeks later, 15 patients (17\%) in the bone marrow group and in whom amastigotes had not been detected, but whose fever continued, were subjected to intercostal splenic aspiration and amastigotes were detected. After 2 months, 3 patients in the intercostal group and 4 patients in the abdominal group gave positive aspirates, and 2 patients in the intercostal group, one in the abdominal group, and one in the bone marrow group did so at the third aspiration. Thus only 200 (74\%) of 270 patients were suffering from VL. It was concluded that, with some precautions, splenic aspiration is a safe and easy method for the diagnosis of VL, and the intercostal route is preferred because it is feasible in a larger proportion of cases and anatomically safer than the abdominal route, and it gives a positive result more often than bone marrow aspiration.},

	abstract = {Miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine [HePC]) is the first orally active drug approved for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. In order to investigate the biochemical modifications occurring in HePC-resistant (HePC-R) Leishmania donovani promastigotes, taking into account the lipid nature of HePC, we investigated their fatty acid and sterol metabolisms. We found that the content of unsaturated phospholipid alkyl chains was lower in HePC-R parasite plasma membranes than in those of the wild type, suggesting a lower fluidity of HePC-R parasite membranes. We also demonstrated that HePC insertion within an external monolayer was more difficult when the proportion of unsaturated phospholipids decreased, rendering the HePC interaction with the external monolayer of HePC-R parasites more difficult. Furthermore, HePC-R parasite membranes displayed a higher content of short alkyl chain fatty acids, suggesting a partial inactivation of the fatty acid elongation enzyme system in HePC-R parasites. Sterol biosynthesis was found to be modified in HePC-R parasites, since the 24-alkylated sterol content was halved in HePC-R parasites; however, this modification was not related to HePC sensitivity. In conclusion, HePC resistance affects three lipid biochemical pathways: fatty acid elongation, the desaturase system responsible for fatty acid alkyl chain unsaturation, and the C-24-alkylation of sterols.},
