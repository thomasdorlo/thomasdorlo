	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Limited available data suggest that older patients are more prone to develop paclitaxel-induced toxicity than their younger peers. It remains unclear whether this is related to age-dependent pharmacokinetics ({PK}) of paclitaxel. Primary objective of this study was to determine the influence of older age on the {PK} of paclitaxel.
{METHODS}: {PK} data of patients aged ≥70years who received paclitaxel intravenously at the Netherlands Cancer Institute ({NKI}) and the Radboud University Medical Center between September 2012 and May 2017 were collected. These prospectively collected data were pooled with previously published databases from multiple clinical trials conducted at the {NKI} and Erasmus {MC} Cancer Institute. A previously developed 3-compartment population {PK} model with saturable distribution and elimination was used to describe paclitaxel plasma concentration-time data. Hereafter, influence of age on paclitaxel {PK} was assessed in a previously established full covariate model.
{RESULTS}: In total, paclitaxel {PK} data from 684 patients were available, consisting of 166 patients ≥70 years (24\%). Median age of the cohort was 61 years (range 18 to 84 years). The impact of age, either treated as a continuous or dichotomous covariate ({\textless}70 versus ≥70 years), on the elimination of paclitaxel was only marginal but statistically significant (both p {\textless} 0.001 with no clinically relevant decrease in interindividual variability). For a typical patient, maximal elimination capacity decreased by only 5\% for a 10-year increment of age.
{CONCLUSION}: In this extensive multi-center dataset, which included a considerable number of older patients, older age had no clinically relevant impact on paclitaxel {PK}.},

	doi = {10.1007/s40262-018-0715-9},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Fludarabine is often used as an important drug in reduced toxicity conditioning regimens prior to hematopoietic cell transplantation ({HCT}). As no definitive pharmacokinetic ({PK}) basis for {HCT} dosing for the wide age and weight range in {HCT} is available, linear body surface area ({BSA})-based dosing is still used.
{OBJECTIVE}: We sought to describe the population {PK} of fludarabine in {HCT} recipients of all ages.
{METHODS}: From 258 {HCT} recipients aged 0.3-74 years, 2605 samples were acquired on days 1 (42\%), 2 (17\%), 3 (4\%) and 4 (37\%) of conditioning. Herein, the circulating metabolite of fludarabine was quantified, and derived concentration-time data were used to build a population {PK} model using non-linear mixed-effects modelling.
{RESULTS}: Variability was extensive where area under the curve ranged from 10 to 66 mg*h/L. A three-compartment model with first-order kinetics best described the data. Actual body weight ({BW}) with standard allometric scaling was found to be the best body-size descriptor for all {PK} parameters. Estimated glomerular filtration rate ({eGFR}) was included as a descriptor of renal function. Thus, clearance was differentiated into a non-renal (3.24 ± 20\% L/h/70 kg) and renal ({eGFR} * 0.782 ± 11\% L/h/70 kg) component. The typical volumes of distribution of the central (V1), peripheral (V2), and second peripheral (V3) compartments were 39 ± 8\%, 20 ± 11\%, and 50 ± 9\% L/70 kg respectively. Intercompartmental clearances between V1 and V2, and V1 and V3, were 8.6 ± 8\% and 3.8 ± 13\% L/h/70 kg, respectively.
{CONCLUSION}: {BW} and {eGFR} are important predictors of fludarabine {PK}. Therefore, current linear {BSA}-based dosing leads to highly variable exposure, which may lead to variable treatment outcome.},

	abstract = {Background: Convenient, safe, and effective treatments for visceral leishmaniasis in Eastern African children are lacking. Miltefosine, the only oral treatment, failed to achieve adequate cure rates in Eastern Africa, particularly in children, in whom linear dosing (2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days) resulted in 59\% cure rate, with lower systemic miltefosine exposure than in adults.
Methods: We conducted a phase-{II} trial in Kenya and Uganda in 30 children, aged 4-12 years, with visceral leishmaniasis, to test whether 28 days of allometric miltefosine dosing is able to safely achieve a higher and more effective systemic exposure of miltefosine than linear dosing (historical data).
Results: Miltefosine accumulated during treatment. Median {AUC}0-210 and Cmax values were slightly higher than those reported previously for children on linear dosing but not dose-proportionally. Miltefosine exposure at start of treatment was increased, with higher median day-7 plasma concentrations (5.88 vs 2.67 µg/{mL}). Concentration-time curves were less variable, avoiding the low levels of exposure observed with linear dosing. The 210-day cure rate was 90\% (95\% confidence interval, 73\%-98\%), similar to that previously described in adults. Nineteen miltefosine-treatment-related adverse events ({AEs}) occurred but none caused treatment discontinuation. Two serious {AEs} occurred, both unrelated to treatment and fully recovering.
Conclusions: Allometric miltefosine dosing achieved increased and less variable exposure than linear dosing, though not reaching the expected exposure levels. The new dosing regimen safely increased the efficacy of miltefosine for Eastern African children with visceral leishmaniasis. Further development of miltefosine should adopt allometric dosing in paediatric patients.},

	abstract = {The artemisinin-based combination therapy artemether-lumefantrine is commonly used in pregnant malaria patients. However, the effect of pregnancy-related changes on exposure is unclear, and pregnancy has been associated with decreased efficacy in previous studies. This study aimed to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of artemether, its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin, and lumefantrine in 22 Rwandese pregnant women in their second (n = 11) or third (n = 11) trimester with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. These patients were enrolled from Rwamagana district hospital and received the standard fixed oral dose combination of 80 mg of artemether and 480 mg of lumefantrine twice daily for 3 days. Venous plasma concentrations were quantified for all three analytes using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectroscopy, and data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Lumefantrine pharmacokinetics was described by a flexible but highly variable absorption, with a mean absorption time of 4.04 h, followed by a biphasic disposition model. The median area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity ({AUC}0-∞) for lumefantrine was 641 h · mg/liter. Model-based simulations indicated that 11.7\% of the study population did not attain the target day 7 plasma concentration (280 ng/ml), a threshold associated with increased risk of recrudescence. The pharmacokinetics of artemether was time dependent, and the autoinduction of its clearance was described using an enzyme turnover model. The turnover half-life was predicted to be 30.4 h. The typical oral clearance, which started at 467 liters/h, increased 1.43-fold at the end of treatment. Simulations suggested that lumefantrine pharmacokinetic target attainment appeared to be reassuring in Rwandese pregnant women, particularly compared to target attainment in Southeast Asia. Larger cohorts will be required to confirm this finding.},

This study aimed to evaluate neopterin, a marker of macrophage activation, as possible pharmacodynamic biomarker to monitor {VL} treatment response and to predict long-term clinical relapse of {VL}. Following informed consent, 497 plasma samples were collected from East-African {VL} patients receiving a 28-day miltefosine monotherapy (48 patients) or 11-day combination therapy of miltefosine and liposomal amphotericin B (L-{AMB}, 48 patients). Neopterin was quantified with {ELISA}. Values are reported as median (inter-quartile range). Baseline neopterin concentrations were elevated in all {VL} patients at 98.8 (63.9-135) nmol/L compared to reported levels for healthy controls ({\textless}10 nmol/L). During the first treatment week, concentrations remained stable in monotherapy patients (p = 0.807), but decreased two-fold compared to baseline in the combination therapy patients (p {\textless} 0.01). In the combination therapy arm, neopterin concentrations increased significantly 1 day after L-{AMB} infusion compared to baseline for cured patients [137 (98.5-197) nmol/L, p {\textless} 0.01], but not for relapsing patients [84.4 (68.9-106) nmol/L, p = 0.96]. The neopterin parameter with the highest predictive power for {VL} relapse was a higher than 8\% neopterin concentration increase between end of treatment and day 60 follow-up ({ROC} {AUC} 0.84), with a 93\% sensitivity and 65\% specificity. In conclusion, the identified neopterin parameter could be a potentially useful surrogate endpoint to identify patients in clinical trials at risk of relapse earlier during follow-up, possibly in a panel of biomarkers to increase its specificity.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Leishmania parasites reside within macrophages and the direct target of antileishmanial drugs is therefore intracellular. We aimed to characterize the intracellular {PBMC} miltefosine kinetics by developing a population pharmacokinetic ({PK}) model simultaneously describing plasma and intracellular {PBMC} pharmacokinetics. Furthermore, we explored exposure-response relationships and simulated alternative dosing regimens.
Patients and methods: A population {PK} model was developed with {NONMEM}, based on 339 plasma and 194 {PBMC} miltefosine concentrations from Colombian cutaneous leishmaniasis patients [29 children (2-12 years old) and 22 adults] receiving 1.8-2.5 mg/kg/day miltefosine for 28 days.
Results: A three-compartment model with miltefosine distribution into an intracellular {PBMC} effect compartment best fitted the data. Intracellular {PBMC} distribution was described with an intracellular-to-plasma concentration ratio of 2.17 [relative standard error ({RSE}) 4.9\%] and intracellular distribution rate constant of 1.23 day-1 ({RSE} 14\%). In exploring exposure-response relationships, both plasma and intracellular model-based exposure estimates significantly influenced probability of cure. A proposed {PK} target for the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (day 0-28) of {\textgreater}535 mg·day/L corresponded to {\textgreater}95\% probability of cure. In linear dosing simulations, 18.3\% of children compared with 2.8\% of adults failed to reach 535 mg·day/L. In children, this decreased to 1.8\% after allometric dosing simulation.
Conclusions: The developed population {PK} model described the rate and extent of miltefosine distribution from plasma into {PBMCs}. Miltefosine exposure was significantly related to probability of cure in this cutaneous leishmaniasis patient population. We propose an exploratory {PK} target, which should be validated in a larger cohort study.},

Administration of anthracyclines prior to trastuzumab increases risk of cardiotoxicity. High-sensitive troponin T and N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide ({NT}-{proBNP}) are molecular markers that may allow earlier detection of drug-induced cardiotoxicity. In this analysis we aimed to quantify the kinetics and exposure-response relationships of {LVEF}, troponin T and {NT}-{proBNP} measurements, in patients receiving anthracycline and trastuzumab. Repeated measurements of {LVEF}, troponin T and {NT}-{proBNP} and dosing records of anthracyclines and trastuzumab were available from a previously published clinical trial. This trial included 206 evaluable patients with early breast cancer. Exposure to anthracycline and trastuzumab was simulated based on available dosing records and by using a kinetic-pharmacodynamic (K-{PD}) and a fixed pharmacokinetic ({PK}) model from literature, respectively. The change from baseline troponin T was described with a direct effect model, affected by simulated anthracycline concentrations, representing myocyte damage. The relationship between trastuzumab and {LVEF} was described by an indirect effect compartment model. The {EC}50 for {LVEF} decline was significantly affected by the maximum troponin T concentration after anthracycline treatment, explaining 15.1\% of inter-individual variability. In this cohort, {NT}-{proBNP} changes could not be demonstrated to be related to anthracycline or trastuzumab treatment. Pharmacodynamic models for troponin T and {LVEF} were successfully developed, identifying maximum troponin T concentration after anthracycline treatment as a significant determinant for trastuzumab-induced {LVEF} decline. These models can help identify patients at risk of drug-induced cardiotoxicity and optimize cardiac monitoring strategies.},

  abstract     = {Patients with visceral leishmaniasis ({VL})-human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) coinfection experience increased drug toxicity and treatment failure rates compared to {VL} patients, with more frequent {VL} relapse and death. In the era of {VL} elimination strategies, {HIV} coinfection is progressively becoming a key challenge, because {HIV}-coinfected patients respond poorly to conventional {VL} treatment and play an important role in parasite transmission. With limited chemotherapeutic options and a paucity of novel anti-parasitic drugs, new interventions that target host immunity may offer an effective alternative. In this review, we first summarize current views on how {VL} immunopathology is significantly affected by {HIV} coinfection. We then review current clinical and promising preclinical immunomodulatory interventions in the field of {VL} and discuss how these may operate in the context of a concurrent {HIV} infection. Caveats are formulated as these interventions may unpredictably impact the delicate balance between boosting of beneficial {VL}-specific responses and deleterious immune activation/hyperinflammation, activation of latent provirus or increased {HIV}-susceptibility of target cells. Evidence is lacking to prioritize a target molecule and a more detailed account of the immunological status induced by the coinfection as well as surrogate markers of cure and protection are still required. We do, however, argue that virologically suppressed {VL} patients with a recovered immune system, in whom effective antiretroviral therapy alone is not able to restore protective immunity, can be considered a relevant target group for an immunomodulatory intervention. Finally, we provide perspectives on the translation of novel theories on synergistic immune cell cross-talk into an effective treatment strategy for {VL}-{HIV}-coinfected patients.},

  abstract     = {Background: Low efficacy of miltefosine in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis was recently observed in Eastern Africa.
Objectives: To describe the pharmacokinetics and establish a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship for miltefosine in Eastern African patients with visceral leishmaniasis, using a time-to-event approach to model relapse of disease.
Methods: Miltefosine plasma concentrations from 95 patients (48 monotherapy versus 47 combination therapy) were included in the population pharmacokinetic model using non-linear mixed effects modelling. Subsequently a time-to-event model was developed to model the time of clinical relapse. Various summary pharmacokinetic parameters (various {AUCs}, Time{\textgreater}{EC}50, Time{\textgreater}{EC}90), normalized within each treatment arm to allow simultaneous analysis, were evaluated as relapse hazard-changing covariates.
Results: A two-compartment population model with first-order absorption fitted the miltefosine pharmacokinetic data adequately. Relative bioavailability was reduced (-74\%, relative standard error 4.7\%) during the first week of treatment of the monotherapy arm but only the first day of the shorter combination regimen. Time to the relapse of infection could be described using a constant baseline hazard (baseline 1.8 relapses/year, relative standard error 72.7\%). Miltefosine Time{\textgreater}{EC}90 improved the model significantly when added in a maximum effect function on the baseline hazard (half maximal effect with Time {\textgreater}{EC}90 6.97 days for monotherapy).
Conclusions: Miltefosine drug exposure was found to be decreased in Eastern African patients with visceral leishmaniasis, due to a (transient) initial lower bioavailability. Relapse hazard was inversely linked to miltefosine exposure. Significantly lower miltefosine exposure was observed in children compared with adults, further urging the need for implementation of dose adaptations for children.},

This overview provides an understanding of their clinical pharmacokinetics, which could assist in rationalising and optimising treatment regimens, especially in combining multiple antileishmanial drugs in an attempt to increase efficacy and shorten treatment duration. Pentavalent antimony pharmacokinetics are characterised by rapid renal excretion of unchanged drug and a long terminal half-life, potentially due to intracellular conversion to trivalent antimony. Pentamidine is the only antileishmanial drug metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Paromomycin is excreted by the kidneys unchanged and is eliminated fastest of all antileishmanial drugs. Miltefosine pharmacokinetics are characterized by a long terminal half-life and extensive accumulation during treatment. {AMB} pharmacokinetics differ per drug formulation, with a fast renal and faecal excretion of {AMB} deoxylate but a much slower clearance of liposomal {AMB} resulting in an approximately ten-fold higher exposure. {AMB} and pentamidine pharmacokinetics have never been evaluated in leishmaniasis patients. Studies linking exposure to effect would be required to define target exposure levels in dose optimisation but have only been performed for miltefosine. Limited research has been conducted on exposure at the drug's site of action, such as skin exposure in cutaneous leishmaniasis patients after systemic administration. Pharmacokinetic data on special patient populations such as {HIV} co-infected patients are mostly lacking. More research in these areas will help improve clinical outcomes by informed dosing and combination of drugs.},

	abstract = {Miltefosine is an oral agent against the neglected tropical disease leishmaniasis, which is mostly endemic in resource-poor areas. Dried blood spot ({DBS}) sampling is an attractive alternative to plasma sampling for pharmacokinetic studies in these remote areas, but introduces additional variability in analyte quantification due to possible blood spot inhomogeneity and variability in blood spot volume and haematocrit values. Volumetric absorptive microsampling ({VAMS}) potentially overcomes a few of these issues as the {VAMS} device absorbs a fixed volume that is processed as a whole. We developed and validated an {LC}-{MS}/{MS} method for the quantification of miltefosine with this novel sampling technique with good performance in terms of linearity, selectivity, accuracy (bias within ±10.8\%), precision ({CV}\%≤11.9\%), recovery, carry-over and matrix effect. {VAMS} samples were stable for at least one month at room temperature and 37°C. The impact of haematocrit on assay accuracy was reduced compared to conventional {DBS} sampling, but indicated a declining recovery with increased haematocrit due to haematocrit dependency in recovery from the sampling device. A clinical validation will be required to investigate whether {VAMS} is an appropriate and cost-effective alternative sampling method to conventional {DBS} sampling.},

Sixty patients, 30 children aged 2 to 12 years and 30 adults aged 18 to 60 years, were enrolled. Participants received miltefosine (Impavido) at a nominal dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days. Miltefosine concentrations were measured in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of samples obtained during treatment and up to 6 months following completion of treatment, when therapeutic outcome was determined. Fifty-two patients were cured, 5 pediatric patients failed treatment, and 3 participants were lost to follow-up. Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis predominated among the strains isolated (42/46; 91\%). Noncompartmental analysis demonstrated that plasma and intracellular miltefosine concentrations were, overall, lower in children than in adults. Exposure to miltefosine, estimated by area under the concentration-time curve and maximum concentration, was significantly lower in children in both the central and intracellular compartments (P {\textless} 0.01). Leishmania persistence was detected in 43\% of study participants at the end of treatment and in 27\% at 90 days after initiation of treatment. Clinical response was not dependent on parasite elimination. In vitro miltefosine susceptibility was similar for Leishmania strains from adults and children. Our results document {PK} differences for miltefosine in children and adults with cutaneous leishmaniasis that affect drug exposure and could influence the outcome of treatment, and they provide bases for optimizing therapeutic regimens for {CL} in pediatric populations.

  abstract     = {{INTRODUCTION}: Neglected tropical diseases ({NTDs}) affect more than one billion people, mainly living in developing countries. For most of these {NTDs}, treatment is suboptimal. To optimize treatment regimens, clinical pharmacokinetic studies are required where they have not been previously conducted to enable the use of pharmacometric modeling and simulation techniques in their application, which can provide substantial advantages.
{OBJECTIVES}: Our aim was to provide a systematic overview and summary of all clinical pharmacokinetic studies in {NTDs} and to assess the use of pharmacometrics in these studies, as well as to identify which of the {NTDs} or which treatments have not been sufficiently studied.
{METHODS}: {PubMed} was systematically searched for all clinical trials and case reports until the end of 2015 that described the pharmacokinetics of a drug in the context of treating any of the {NTDs} in patients or healthy volunteers.
{RESULTS}: Eighty-two pharmacokinetic studies were identified. Most studies included small patient numbers (only five studies included {\textgreater}50 subjects) and only nine (11\%) studies included pediatric patients. A large part of the studies was not very recent; 56\% of studies were published before 2000. Most studies applied non-compartmental analysis methods for pharmacokinetic analysis (62\%). Twelve studies used population-based compartmental analysis (15\%) and eight (10\%) additionally performed simulations or extrapolation. For ten out of the 17 {NTDs}, none or only very few pharmacokinetic studies could be identified.
{CONCLUSIONS}: For most {NTDs}, adequate pharmacokinetic studies are lacking and population-based modeling and simulation techniques have not generally been applied. Pharmacokinetic clinical trials that enable population pharmacokinetic modeling are needed to make better use of the available data. Simulation-based studies should be employed to enable the design of improved dosing regimens and more optimally use the limited resources to effectively provide therapy in this neglected area.},

Combination regimens including {AmBisome} and miltefosine are safe and effective in India, but there are no published data from trials of combination therapies including these drugs from Africa.
{METHODS}: A phase {II} open-label, non-comparative randomized trial was conducted in Sudan and Kenya to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three treatment regimens: 10 mg/kg single dose {AmBisome} plus 10 days of {SSG} (20 mg/kg/day), 10 mg/kg single dose {AmBisome} plus 10 days of miltefosine (2.5mg/kg/day) and miltefosine alone (2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days). The primary endpoint was initial parasitological cure at Day 28, and secondary endpoints included definitive cure at Day 210, and pharmacokinetic (miltefosine) and pharmacodynamic assessments.
{RESULTS}: In sequential analyses with 49-51 patients per arm, initial cure was 85\% (95\% {CI}: 73-92) in all arms. At D210, definitive cure was 87\% (95\% {CI}: 77-97) for {AmBisome} + {SSG}, 77\% (95\% {CI} 64-90) for {AmBisome} + miltefosine and 72\% (95\% {CI} 60-85) for miltefosine alone, with lower efficacy in younger patients, who weigh less. Miltefosine pharmacokinetic data indicated under-exposure in children compared to adults.
{CONCLUSION}: No major safety concerns were identified, but point estimates of definitive cure were less than 90\% for each regimen so none will be evaluated in Phase {III} trials in their current form. Allometric dosing of miltefosine in children needs to be evaluated.

Its prophylactic activity was tested to establish exposure-activity relationships, while a 5+5 day oral regimen at 20 mg/kg with long post-treatment follow-up was performed to assess its curative potential.
{METHODS}: Single oral doses of 20, 50 and 100 mg/kg were administered for pharmacokinetic analysis while a 100 mg/kg single oral dose was given on day 7, 4 or 1, or 4 h prior to infection in the prophylactic efficacy study. The animals were infected on day 0 with Leishmania infantum and the resulting parasite burdens were measured in target organs on day 21. In the curative model, treatment started on day 21 post-infection at 20 mg/kg for 5+5 days and amastigote burdens were determined in target organs either on day 42 [10 days after the end of treatment (dpt)] or day 72 (40 dpt).
{RESULTS}: {OlPC} showed elimination t1/2 of ∼50 h and dose-proportional exposure. The prophylactic action of {OlPC} was in agreement with model-simulated drug exposures, showing dose-dependent residual activity. Interestingly, the 100 mg/kg single dose administered 4 days before infection (day -4) still reduced the overall parasite burden by ∼50\%. In the curative model, {\textgreater}99\% clearance of infection was observed at 10 dpt in all {OlPC}-treated animals and remained so at 40 dpt.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This study reveals that total plasma exposure ({AUCt}-∞) correlates well with the prophylactic and curative efficacy of {OlPC} in the L. infantum hamster model.},

The direct activity of antileishmanials must therefore depend on intracellular drug transport, metabolism, and accumulation within the host cell. In this study, we explored the role of human macrophage transporters in the intracellular accumulation and antileishmanial activity of miltefosine ({MLF}), the only oral drug available for the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis ({CL}). Membrane transporter gene expression in primary human macrophages infected in vitro with Leishmania Viannia panamensis and exposed to {MLF} showed modulation of {ABC} and solute liquid carrier transporters gene transcripts. Among these, {ABCA}3, a lipid transporter, was significantly induced after exposure to {MLF}, and this induction was confirmed in primary macrophages from {CL} patients. Functional validation of {MLF} as a substrate for {ABCA}3 was performed by {shRNA} gene knockdown ({KD}) in {THP}-1 monocytes. Intracellular accumulation of radiolabeled {MLF} was significantly higher in {ABCA}3({KD}) macrophages. {ABCA}3({KD}) resulted in increased cytotoxicity induced by {MLF} exposure. {ABCA}3 gene expression inversely correlated with intracellular {MLF} content in primary macrophages from {CL} patients. {ABCA}3({KD}) reduced parasite survival during macrophage infection with an L. V. panamensis strain exhibiting low in vitro susceptibility to {MLF}. Confocal microscopy showed {ABCA}3 to be located in the cell membrane of resting macrophages and in intracellular compartments in L. V. panamensis-infected cells. These results provide evidence of {ABCA}3 as an {MLF} efflux transporter in human macrophages and support its role in the direct antileishmanial effect of this alkylphosphocholine drug.},

The aims of this study were to validate a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to quantify miltefosine in dried blood spot ({DBS}) samples and to validate its use with Ethiopian patients with visceral leishmaniasis ({VL}). Since hematocrit (Ht) levels are typically severely decreased in {VL} patients, returning to normal during treatment, the method was evaluated over a range of clinically relevant Ht values. Miltefosine was extracted from {DBS} samples using a simple method of pretreatment with methanol, resulting in {\textgreater}97\% recovery. The method was validated over a calibration range of 10 to 2,000 ng/ml, and accuracy and precision were within ±11.2\% and ≤7.0\% (≤19.1\% at the lower limit of quantification), respectively. The method was accurate and precise for blood spot volumes between 10 and 30 μl and for Ht levels of 20 to 35\%, although a linear effect of Ht levels on miltefosine quantification was observed in the bioanalytical validation. {DBS} samples were stable for at least 162 days at 37°C. Clinical validation of the method using paired {DBS} and plasma samples from 16 {VL} patients showed a median observed {DBS}/plasma miltefosine concentration ratio of 0.99, with good correlation (Pearson'sr= 0.946). Correcting for patient-specific Ht levels did not further improve the concordance between the sampling methods. This successfully validated method to quantify miltefosine in {DBS} samples was demonstrated to be a valid and practical alternative to venous blood sampling that can be applied in future miltefosine pharmacokinetic studies with leishmaniasis patients, without Ht correction.},

The maintenance dose is adapted to body weight ({BW}) or liver function (Child-Pugh score B or C). We aimed to study the pharmacokinetics of caspofungin and assess pharmacokinetic target attainment for various dosing strategies.
{METHODS}: Caspofungin pharmacokinetic data from 21 intensive care unit ({ICU}) patients was available. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed. Various dosing regimens (loading dose/maintenance dose) were simulated: licensed regimens (I) 70/50mg (for {BW} {\textless}80kg) or 70/70mg (for {BW} {\textgreater}80kg); and ({II}) 70/35mg (for Child-Pugh score B); and adapted regimens ({III}) 100/50 mg (for Child-Pugh score B); ({IV}) 100/70 mg; and (V) 100/100 mg. Target attainment based on a preclinical pharmacokinetic target for Candida albicans was assessed for relevant minimal inhibitory concentrations ({MICs}).
{RESULTS}: A two-compartment model best fitted the data. Clearance was 0.55L/h and the apparent volumes of distribution in the central and peripheral compartments were 8.9 and 5.0 L, respectively. The median area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 h on day 14 for regimens I-V were 105, 65, 93, 130, and 186 mg·h/L, respectively. Pharmacokinetic target attainment was 100\% ({MIC} 0.03 µg/{mL}) irrespective of dosing regimen but decreased to (I) 47\%, ({II}) 14\%, ({III}) 36\%, ({IV}) 69\%, and (V) 94\% for {MIC} 0.125 µg/{mL}.
{CONCLUSION}: The caspofungin maintenance dose should not be reduced in non-cirrhotic {ICU} patients based on the Child-Pugh score if this classification is driven by hypoalbuminemia as it results in significantly lower exposure. A higher maintenance dose of 70 mg in {ICU} patients results in target attainment of {\textgreater}90\% of the {ICU} patients with species with an {MIC} of up to 0.125 µg/{mL}.},

  abstract     = {Balamuthia mandrillaris, a free-living ameba, causes rare but frequently fatal granulomatous amebic encephalitis ({GAE}). Few patients have survived after receiving experimental drug combinations, with or without brain lesion excisions. Some {GAE} survivors have been treated with a multi-drug regimen including miltefosine, an investigational anti-leishmanial agent with in vitro amebacidal activity. Miltefosine dosing for {GAE} has been based on leishmaniasis dosing because no data exist in humans concerning its pharmacologic distribution in the central nervous system. We describe results of limited cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) and serum drug level testing performed during clinical management of a child with fatal {GAE} who was treated with a multiple drug regimen including miltefosine. Brain biopsy specimens, {CSF}, and sera were tested for B. mandrillaris using multiple techniques, including culture, real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemical techniques, and serology. {CSF} and serum miltefosine levels were determined using a liquid chromatography method coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The {CSF} miltefosine concentration on hospital admission day 12 was 0.4 μg/{mL}. The serum miltefosine concentration on day 37, about 80 h post-miltefosine treatment, was 15.3 μg/{mL}. These are the first results confirming some blood-brain barrier penetration by miltefosine in a human, although with low-level {CSF} accumulation. Further evaluation of brain parenchyma penetration is required to determine optimal miltefosine dosing for Balamuthia {GAE}, balanced with the drug's toxicity profile. Additionally, the Balamuthia isolate was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}), demonstrating genetic variability in 18S ribosomal {RNA} (18S {rRNA}) sequences and possibly signaling the first identification of multiple Balamuthia strains with varying pathogenicities.},

  abstract     = {Phagocytes, the physiological compartment in which Leishmania parasites reside, are the main site of action of the drug miltefosine, but the intracellular pharmacokinetics of miltefosine remain unexplored. We developed a bioanalytical method to quantify miltefosine in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMCs}), expanding from an existing high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the quantification of miltefosine in plasma. The method introduced deuterated miltefosine as an internal standard. Miltefosine was extracted from {PBMC} pellets by addition of 62.5\% methanol. Supernatant was collected, evaporated and reconstituted in plasma. Chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed phase C18 column and detection with a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. Miltefosine was quantified using plasma calibration standards ranging from 4 to 1000ng/{mL}. This method was validated with respect to its {PBMC} matrix effect, selectivity, recovery and stability. No matrix effect could be observed from the {PBMC} content (ranging from 0.17 to 26.3×10(6){PBMCs}) reconstituted in plasma, as quality control samples were within 3.0\% of the nominal concentration (precision less than 7.7\%). At the lower limit of quantitation of 4 ng/{mL} plasma, corresponding to 0.12ng/10(6) {PBMCs} in a typical clinical sample, measured concentrations were within 8.6\% of the nominal value. Recovery showed to be reproducible as adding additional pre-treatment steps did not increase the recovery with more than 9\%. This method was successfully applied to measure intracellular miltefosine concentrations in {PBMC} samples from six cutaneous leishmaniasis patients up to one month post-treatment.},

  abstract     = {{AIM}: The aim was to investigate the population pharmacokinetics of levamisole in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome.
{METHODS}: Non-linear mixed effects modelling was performed on samples collected during a randomized controlled trial. Samples were collected from children who were receiving 2.5 mg kg(-1) levamisole (or placebo) orally once every other day. One hundred and thirty-six plasma samples were collected from 38 children from India and Europe and included in the analysis. A one compartment model described the data well.
{RESULTS}: The apparent clearance rate ({CL}/F) and distribution volume (V/F) were 44 l h(-1) 70 kg(-1) and 236 l 70 kg(-1) , respectively; estimated interindividual variability was 32-42\%. In addition to allometric scaling of {CL}/F and V/F to body weight, we identified a significant proportional effect of age on {CL}/F (-10.1\% per year). The pharmacokinetics parameters were not affected by gender, tablet strength or study centre. The median (interquartile range) maximum plasma concentration of levamisole was 438.3 (316.5-621.8) ng ml(-1) , and the median area under the concentration-time curve was 2847 (2267-3761) ng ml(-1) h. Median tmax and t½ values were 1.65 (1.32-2.0) h and 2.60 (2.06-3.65) h, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Here, we present the first pharmacokinetic data regarding levamisole in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. The pharmacokinetic profile of levamisole in children was similar to findings reported in adults, although the elimination rate was slightly higher in children.},

  abstract     = {Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the development of new drugs for the treatment of leishmaniasis. This has spurred the need for pharmacodynamic markers to monitor and compare therapies specifically for visceral leishmaniasis, in which the primary recrudescence of parasites is a particularly long-term event that remains difficult to predict. We performed a systematic review of studies evaluating biomarkers in human patients with visceral, cutaneous, and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, which yielded a total of 170 studies in which 53 potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers were identified. In conclusion, the large majority of these biomarkers constituted universal indirect markers of activation and subsequent waning of cellular immunity and therefore lacked specificity. Macrophage-related markers demonstrate favorable sensitivity and times to normalcy, but more evidence is required to establish a link between these markers and clinical outcome. Most promising are the markers directly related to the parasite burden, but future effort should be focused on optimization of molecular or antigenic targets to increase the sensitivity of these markers. In general, future research should focus on the longitudinal evaluation of the pharmacodynamic biomarkers during treatment, with an emphasis on the correlation of studied biomarkers and clinical parameters.},

  abstract     = {{BACKGROUND}: High frequency of relapse in miltefosine-treated visceral leishmaniasis ({VL}) patients in India and Nepal followed up for twelve months.
{OBJECTIVE}: To identify epidemiological and clinical risk factors for relapse of {VL} in patients recently treated with standard dosing of miltefosine in India and Nepal.
{DESIGN}: Prospective observational study in three Primary Health Centers and one reference center in Muzaffarpur district, Bihar, India; and two zonal hospitals and a university hospital in South-east Nepal; records of all consenting patients diagnosed with {VL} and treated with miltefosine according to the current treatment guidelines of the Kala azar elimination program between 2009 and 2011.
{RESULTS}: We compared the clinical records of 78 cases of relapse with those of 775 patients who had no record of subsequent relapse. Relapse was 2 times more common amongst male patients ({IRR} 2.14, 95\% {CI} 1.27-3.61), and 2 to 3 times more frequent in the age groups below 15 compared to the over 25 year olds (age 10 to 14: {IRR} 2.53; 95\% {CI} 1.37-4.65 and Age 2 to 9: {IRR} 3.19; 95\% {CI} 1.77-5.77). History of earlier {VL} episodes, or specific clinical features at time of diagnosis such as duration of symptoms or spleen size were no predictors of relapse.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Young age and male gender were associated with increased risk of {VL} relapse after miltefosine, suggesting that the mechanism of relapse is mainly host-related i.e. immunological factors and/or drug exposure (pharmacokinetics). The observed decrease in efficacy of miltefosine may be explained by the inclusion of younger patients compared to the earlier clinical trials, rather than by a decreased susceptibility of the parasite to miltefosine. Our findings highlight the importance of proper clinical trials in children, including pharmacokinetics, to determine the safety, efficacy, drug exposure and therapeutic response of new drugs in this age group.},

  abstract     = {{BACKGROUND}: Anti-leishmanial drug regimens that include a single dose {AmBisome} could be suitable for eastern African patients with symptomatic visceral leishmaniasis ({VL}) but the appropriate single dose is unknown.
{METHODOLOGY}: A multi-centre, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial with an adaptive design, was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of a single dose and multiple doses of {AmBisome} for the treatment of {VL} in eastern Africa. The primary efficacy endpoint was definitive cure ({DC}) at 6 months. Symptomatic patients with parasitologically-confirmed, non-severe {VL}, received a single dose of {AmBisome} 7.5 mg/kg body weight or multiple doses, 7 times 3 mg/kg on days 1-5, 14, and 21. If interim analyses, evaluated 30 days after the start of treatment following 40 or 80 patients, showed the single dose gave significantly poorer parasite clearance than multiple doses at the 5\% significance level, the single dose was increased by 2·5 mg/kg. In a sub-set of patients, parasite clearance was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase ({qRT}) {PCR}.
{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}: The trial was terminated after the third interim analysis because of low efficacy of both regimens. Based on the intention-to-treat population, {DC} was 85\% (95\%{CI} 73-93\%), 40\% (95\%{CI} 19-64\%), and 58\% (95\%{CI} 41-73\%) in patients treated with multiple doses (n = 63), and single doses of 7·5 (n = 21) or 10 mg/kg (n = 40), respectively. {qRT}-{PCR} suggested superior parasite clearance with multiple doses as early as day 3. Safety data accorded with the drug label.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The tested {AmBisome} regimens would not be suitable for {VL} treatment across eastern Africa. An optimal single dose regimen was not identified.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Recent reports indicated high miltefosine treatment failure rates for visceral leishmaniasis ({VL}) on the Indian subcontinent. To further explore the pharmacological factors associated with these treatment failures, a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study was performed to examine the relationship between miltefosine drug exposure and treatment failure in a cohort of Nepalese patients with {VL}.
{METHODS}: Miltefosine steady-state blood concentrations at the end of treatment were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling and a logistic regression model. Individual estimates of miltefosine exposure were explored for their relationship with treatment failure.
{RESULTS}: The overall probability of treatment failure was 21\%. The time that the blood concentration was {\textgreater}10 times the half maximal effective concentration of miltefosine (median, 30.2 days) was significantly associated with treatment failure: each 1-day decrease in miltefosine exposure was associated with a 1.08-fold (95\% confidence interval, 1.01-1.17) increased odds of treatment failure.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Achieving a sufficient exposure to miltefosine is a significant and critical factor for {VL} treatment success, suggesting an urgent need to evaluate the recently proposed optimal allometric miltefosine dosing regimen. This study establishes the first evidence for a drug exposure-effect relationship for miltefosine in the treatment of {VL}.},

{DESIGN}: Systematic literature review of published meta-analyses and case-control studies, supported by relevant literature on the effects of corticosteroids in relation to the development of ulcers.
{METHOD}: Analysis of literature was performed using the {PubMed} database with the search terms 'adrenal cortex hormones', 'peptic ulcer' and their synonyms. Meta-analyses and case-control studies with more than 1000 patients were included.
{RESULTS}: The literature search resulted in 970 articles, of which 3 were classified as relevant meta-analyses and 3 as relevant case-control studies. All meta-analyses indicated that peptic ulcer is, at the most, a rare complication of systemic corticosteroid therapy occurring in less than 0.4-1.8\% of patients. As the incidence is low, there is no indication for routine prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors in combination with systemic corticosteroids. There is convincing evidence showing an increased risk of ulcers and a poorer recovery from these when {NSAIDs} and systemic corticosteroids are used concomitantly; this is a combination for which a proton pump inhibitor should be prescribed.
{CONCLUSION}: Systemic corticosteroid therapy only rarely causes a peptic ulcer. Routine prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors is therefore not indicated for short-term systemic corticosteroid use.},

No significant clinical risk factors of relapse apart from age {\textless}12 years were found. Parasite fingerprints of pretreatment and relapse bone marrow isolates within 8 patients were similar, suggesting that clinical relapses were not due to reinfection with a new strain. The mean promastigote {MIL} susceptibility (50\% inhibitory concentration) of isolates from definite cures was similar to that of relapses. Although more tolerant strains were observed, parasite resistance, as currently measured, is thus not likely involved in {MIL} treatment failure. Moreover, {MIL} blood levels at the end of treatment were similar in cured and relapsed patients.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Relapse in one-fifth of the {MIL}-treated patients observed in our study is an alarming signal for the {VL} elimination campaign, urging for further review and cohort monitoring.},

{METHODS}: This is a prospective cohort study of 171 patients with Visceral leishmaniasis ({VL}) in three healthcare settings in Nepal. Adherence was assessed through pill count, checking of treatment cards and adherence questionnaires, as well as miltefosine concentration measurements at the end of treatment. Poor adherence was defined as less than 90\% of required capsules taken.
{RESULTS}: Patient adherence to miltefosine was 83\%. Predictors of adherence were being the male sex ({OR} = 2.60, 95\% {CI} 1.02-6.67) and knowing the duration of treatment ({OR} = 3.05, 95\% {CI} 1.16-8.04). Adherence was also better for patients who were literate and knew the side effects of treatment. Gastrointestinal side effects and negligence after the resolution of clinical symptoms of {VL} were the main reasons for poor adherence. Poor adherence was associated (though not statistically significant) with future relapse.
{CONCLUSION}: Effective counselling during the treatment, a short take-home message on {VL} and on side effects and action of miltefosine, and follow-up visits are the best way to prevent poor adherence. Single end-of-treatment measurements of miltefosine concentrations as objective assessment of adherence would only be useful in addition to the subjective assessments when substantial doses of miltefosine have been missed.},

For 10 years it has been licensed in India for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis ({VL}), a fatal neglected parasitic disease. It is the first and still the only oral drug that can be used to treat {VL} and cutaneous leishmaniasis ({CL}). The standard 28 day miltefosine monotherapy regimen is well tolerated, except for mild gastrointestinal side effects, although its teratogenic potential severely hampers its general use in the clinic and roll-out in national elimination programmes. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine are mainly characterized by its long residence time in the body, resulting in extensive drug accumulation during treatment and long elimination half-lives. At the moment, different combination therapy strategies encompassing miltefosine are being tested in multiple controlled clinical trials in various geographical areas of endemicity, both in South Asia and East Africa. We here review the most salient pre-clinical and clinical pharmacological aspects of miltefosine, its mechanism of action against Leishmania parasites and other pathogens, and provide a systematic overview of the efficacy and safety data from all clinical trials of miltefosine, either alone or in combination, in the treatment of {VL} and {CL}.},

While failure rates were higher in children with {VL}, steady-state concentrations appeared lower than those seen with adults. We hypothesized that the current linear dosage (in milligrams per kilogram of body weight) is too low for children and that a new dosing algorithm based on an appropriate body size model would result in an optimal exposure. A population {PK} analysis was performed on three historic pooled data sets, including Indian children, Indian adults, and European adults. Linear and allometric scaling of {PK} parameters by either body weight or fat-free mass ({FFM}) was evaluated for body size models. Based on the developed {PK} model, a dosing algorithm for miltefosine in children and adults was proposed and evaluated in silico. The population {PK} model employing allometric scaling fitted best to the pooled miltefosine data. Allometric scaling by {FFM} reduced between-subject variability, e.g., for drug clearance, from 49.6\% to 32.1\%. A new allometric miltefosine dosing algorithm was proposed. Exposure to miltefosine was lower in children than adults receiving 2.5 mg/kg/day: a C(max) of 18.8 μg/ml was reached by 90\% of adults and 66.7\% of children. The allometric daily dose resulted in similar levels of exposure to miltefosine for adults and children. The use of a new allometric dosing algorithm for miltefosine in {VL} patients results in optimal exposure to miltefosine in both adults and children and might improve clinical outcome in children.},

  abstract     = {{OBJECTIVES}: Use of miltefosine in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis ({VL}) is hampered by its potential teratogenicity. The duration of adequate contraceptive cover in females of child-bearing potential after cessation of a potentially teratogenic drug therapy remains debated. The objective of this study was to provide a rational approach to suggest durations of contraceptive cover for various miltefosine regimens.
{METHODS}: A human reproductive safety threshold exposure limit was derived using animal-to-human dose conversion. Pharmacokinetic ({PK}) data for miltefosine in females are lacking; a previously developed population {PK} model and a comprehensive anthropometric dataset were used to simulate {PK} data for Indian female {VL} patients receiving miltefosine for 5, 7, 10 or 28 days. Probability of supra-threshold miltefosine exposure was used to evaluate adequate durations of post-treatment contraceptive cover for the various regimens.
{RESULTS}: {PK} data were simulated for 465 treated Indian female {VL} patients of child-bearing potential with a median age of 25 years ({IQR} 16-31 years) and median weight of 38 kg ({IQR} 34-42 kg). From animal reproductive toxicity studies, a human reproductive safety threshold exposure limit was derived of 24.5 μg*day/{mL}. Probability of 'unprotected' supra-threshold miltefosine exposure was very low ({\textless}0.2\%) for a post-treatment contraceptive cover period of 4 months for the standard 28 day regimen, and of 2 months for the shorter regimens.
{CONCLUSIONS}: To our knowledge, this is the first study providing rational suggestions for contraceptive cover for a teratogenic drug based on animal-to-human dose conversion. For the 28 day miltefosine regimen, post-treatment contraceptive cover may be extended to 4 months, whereas for all shorter regimens 2 months may be adequate.},

We investigated the pharmacokinetics of artemether, dihydroartemisinin and lumefantrine after administration of a single dose of 80/480 mg of artemether/lumefantrine to {HIV}-infected adults, taken with and without lopinavir/ritonavir.
{METHODS}: A two-arm parallel study of 13 {HIV}-infected {ART}-naive adults and 16 {HIV}-infected adults stable on 400/100 mg of lopinavir/ritonavir plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ({ClinicalTrials}.gov, {NCT} 00619944). Each participant received a single dose of 80/480 mg of artemether/lumefantrine under continuous cardiac function monitoring. Plasma concentrations of artemether, dihydroartemisinin and lumefantrine were measured.
{RESULTS}: Co-administration of artemether/lumefantrine with lopinavir/ritonavir significantly reduced artemether maximum concentration (C(max)) and area under the concentration-time curve ({AUC}) [median (range): 112 (20-362) versus 56 (17-236) ng/{mL}, P = 0.03; and 264 (92-1129) versus 151 (38-606) ng · h/{mL}, P {\textless} 0.01]. Dihydroartemisinin C(max) and {AUC} were not affected [66 (10-111) versus 73 (31-224) ng/{mL}, P = 0.55; and 213 (68-343) versus 175 (118-262) ng · h/{mL} P = 0.27].

Here we report on the methods to characterize and identify miltefosine in pharmaceutical products and the procedures that were used to assess the quality of these suspected counterfeit products. Characterization and identification of miltefosine were done with liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}/{MS}), Fourier transform infrared ({FT}-{IR}) spectroscopy and near-infrared ({NIR}) spectroscopy. Moreover, a simple, rapid and inexpensive colorimetric test was developed and evaluated for the detection of miltefosine in pharmaceutical products that can be used in the field. The complementary analytical techniques presented here were able to determine qualitatively or (semi-)quantitatively the presence or absence of miltefosine in pharmaceutical preparations and could identify suspected counterfeit miltefosine capsules. This finding of a suspected counterfeit drug intended to treat a neglected disease in a resource-poor country emphasizes the urgent need to develop more simple inexpensive assays to evaluate drug quality for use in the field.},

  abstract     = {{BACKGROUND}: Treatment options for visceral leishmaniasis ({VL}) in East Africa are far from satisfactory due to cost, toxicity, prolonged treatment duration or emergence of parasite resistance. Hence there is a need to explore alternative treatment protocols such as miltefosine alone or in combinations including miltefosine, sodium stibogluconate ({SSG}) or liposomal amphotericin B. The aim of this trial is to identify regimen(s) which are sufficiently promising for future trials in East Africa.
{METHODS}/{DESIGN}: A phase {II} randomized, parallel arm, open-labelled trial is being conducted to assess the efficacy of each of the three regimens: liposomal amphotericin B with {SSG}, Liposomal amphotericin B with miltefosine and miltefosine alone. The primary endpoint is cure at day 28 with secondary endpoint at day 210 (6 months). Initial cure is a single composite measure based on parasitologic evaluation (bone marrow, spleen or lymph node aspirate) and clinical assessment. Repeated interim analyses have been planned after recruitment of 15 patients in each arm with a maximum sample size of 63 for each. These will follow group-sequential methods (the triangular test) to identify when a regimen is inadequate ({\textless}75\% efficacy) or adequate ({\textgreater}90\% efficacy). We describe a method to ensure consistency of the sequential analysis of day 28 cure with the non-sequential analysis of day 210 cure.
{DISCUSSION}: A regimen with adequate efficacy would be a candidate for treatment of {VL} with reasonable costs. The design allows repeated testing throughout the trial recruitment period while maintaining good statistical properties (Type I \& {II} error rates) and reducing the expected sample sizes.

  abstract     = {The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in leishmaniasis patients are, to a great extent, unknown. We examined and characterized the pharmacokinetics of miltefosine in a group of patients with Old World (Leishmania major) cutaneous leishmaniasis. Miltefosine plasma concentrations were determined in samples taken during and up to 5 months after the end of treatment from 31 Dutch military personnel who contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis in Afghanistan and were treated with 150 mg miltefosine/day for 28 days. Samples were analyzed with a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay with a lower limit of quantification ({LLOQ}) of 4 ng/ml. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed with nonlinear mixed-effect modeling, using {NONMEM}. The pharmacokinetics of miltefosine could best be described by an open two-compartment disposition model, with a first elimination half-life of 7.05 days and a terminal elimination half-life of 30.9 days. The median concentration in the last week of treatment (days 22 to 28) was 30,800 ng/ml. The maximum duration of follow-up was 202 days after the start of treatment. All analyzed samples contained a concentration above the {LLOQ}. Miltefosine is eliminated from the body much slower than previously thought and is therefore still detectable in human plasma samples taken 5 to 6 months after the end of treatment. The presence of subtherapeutic miltefosine concentrations in the blood beyond 5 months after treatment might contribute to the selection of resistant parasites, and moreover, the measures for preventing the teratogenic risks of miltefosine treatment should be reconsidered.},

  abstract     = {Pentamidine has a long history in the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis ({HAT}) and leishmaniasis. Early guidelines on the dosage of pentamidine were based on the base-moiety of the two different formulations available. Confusion on the dosage of pentamidine arose from a different labelling of the two available products, either based on the salt or base moiety available in the preparation. We provide an overview of the various guidelines concerning {HAT} and leishmaniasis over the past decades and show the confusion in the calculation of the dosage of pentamidine in these guidelines and the subsequent published reports on clinical trials and reviews. At present, only pentamidine isethionate is available, but the advised dosage for {HAT} and leishmaniasis is (historically) based on the amount of pentamidine base. In the treatment of leishmaniasis this is probably resulting in a subtherapeutic treatment. There is thus a need for a new, more transparent and concise guideline concerning the dosage of pentamidine, at least in the treatment of {HAT} and leishmaniasis.},

	abstract = {A sensitive and specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}/{MS}) assay for the quantification of miltefosine is presented. A 250 {microL} human {EDTA} plasma aliquot was spiked with miltefosine and extracted by a solid-phase extraction method. Separation was performed on a Gemini C18 column (150 mm x 2.0 mm I.D., 5 microm) using an alkaline eluent. Detection was performed by positive ion electrospray ionization followed by triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry. The assay has been validated for miltefosine from 4 to 2000 ng/{mL} using 250 {microL} human {EDTA} plasma samples. Results from the validation demonstrate that miltefosine can be accurately and precisely quantified in human plasma. At the lowest level, the intra-assay precision was lower than 10.7\%, the inter-assay precision was 10.6\% and accuracies were between 95.1 and 109\%. This assay is successfully used in a clinical pharmacokinetic study with miltefosine.},

Miltefosine is the first oral drug that is efficacious against different forms ofleishmaniasis, however it is not equally effective against all Leishmania species. Miltefosine is an alkylphosphocholine, originally developed for the treatment of cancer. The mechanism of action is probably based on interference with the synthesis and degradation of parasitic membrane lipids. Little is known about the pharmacokinetics ofmiltefosine; an important characteristic is its long elimination half-life of seven days or longer. The most frequent adverse effects are of gastrointestinal origin. Miltefosine should not be used during pregnancy. Over thirty leishmaniasis patients have already been treated with miltefosine in the Netherlands.},
