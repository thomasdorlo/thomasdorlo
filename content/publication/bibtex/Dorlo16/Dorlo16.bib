	abstract = {Fludarabine is the most frequently used agent in conditioning regimens for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Body surface area-based dosing leads to highly variable fludarabine exposure. We studied the relation between fludarabine exposure and clinical outcomes. A retrospective, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis was conducted with data from patients undergoing HCT with fludarabine (160 mg/m2) as part of a myeloablative conditioning (busulfan targeted to an area under the plasma-concentration-time curve [AUC] of 90 mg*h/L) and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (6-10 mg/kg; from day -9/-12) between 2010 and 2016. Fludarabine exposure as AUC was calculated for each patient using a previously published population pharmacokinetic model and related to 2-year event-free survival (EFS) by means of (parametric) time-to-event models. Relapse, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), and graft failure were considered events. One hundred ninety-two patients were included (68 benign and 124 malignant disorders). The optimal fludarabine exposure was determined as an AUC of 20 mg*h/L. In the overexposed group, EFS was lower (hazard ratio [HR], 2.0; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.5; P = .02), due to higher NRM (HR, 3.4; 95\% CI, 1.6-6.9; P {\textless}001) associated with impaired immune reconstitution (HR, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.26-0.70; P {\textless}001). The risks of NRM and graft failure were increased in the underexposed group (HR, 3.3; 95\% CI, 1.2-9.4; P = .02; HR, 4.8; 95\% CI, 1.2-19; P = .02, respectively). No relationship with relapse was found. Fludarabine exposure is a strong predictor of survival after HCT, stressing the importance of optimum fludarabine dosing. Individualized dosing, based on weight and "renal function" or "therapeutic drug monitoring," to achieve optimal fludarabine exposure might improve survival.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The pharmacokinetics (PK) of the 20S proteasome inhibitor bortezomib are characterized by a large volume of distribution and a rapid decline in plasma concentrations within the first hour after administration. An increase in exposure was observed in the second week of treatment, which has previously been explained by extensive binding of bortezomib to proteasome in erythrocytes and peripheral tissues. We characterized the nonlinear population PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of bortezomib in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
METHODS: Overall, 323 samples from 28 patients were available from a pediatric clinical study investigating bortezomib at an intravenous dose of 1.3 mg/m2 twice weekly (Dutch Trial Registry number 1881/ITCC021). A semi-physiological PK model for bortezomib was first developed; the PK were linked to the decrease in 20S proteasome activity in the final PK/PD model.
RESULTS: The plasma PK data were adequately described using a two-compartment model with linear elimination. Increased concentrations were observed in week 2 compared with week 1, which was described using a Langmuir binding model. The decrease in 20S proteasome activity was best described by a direct effect model with a sigmoidal maximal inhibitory effect, representing the relationship between plasma concentrations and effect. The maximal inhibitory effect was 0.696 pmol AMC/s/mg protein (95\% confidence interval 0.664-0.728) after administration.
CONCLUSION: The semi-physiological model adequately described the nonlinear PK and PD of bortezomib in plasma. This model can be used to further optimize dosing of bortezomib.},

	abstract = {Host immune responses are pivotal for the successful treatment of the leishmaniases, a spectrum of infections caused by Leishmania parasites. Previous studies speculated that augmenting cytokines associated with a type 1 T-helper cell (Th1) response is necessary to combat severe forms of leishmaniasis, and it has been hypothesized that the antileishmanial drug miltefosine is capable of immunomodulation and induction of Th1 cytokines. A better understanding of the immunomodulatory effects of miltefosine is central to providing a rationale regarding synergistic mechanisms of activity to combine miltefosine optimally with other conventional and future antileishmanials that are currently under development. Therefore, a systematic literature search was performed to evaluate to what extent and how miltefosine influences the host Th1 response. Miltefosine's effects observed in both a preclinical and a clinical context associated with immunomodulation in the treatment of leishmaniasis are evaluated in this review. A total of 27 studies were included in the analysis. Based on the current evidence, miltefosine is not only capable of inducing direct parasite killing but also of modulating the host immunity. Our findings suggest that miltefosine-induced activation of Th1 cytokines, particularly represented by increased gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and interleukin 12 (IL-12), is essential to prevail over the Leishmania-driven Th2 response. Differences in miltefosine-induced host-mediated effects between in vitro, ex vivo, animal model, and human studies are further discussed. All things considered, an effective treatment with miltefosine is acquired by enhanced functional Th1 cytokine responses and may further be enhanced in combination with immunostimulatory agents.},
