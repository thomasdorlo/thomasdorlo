  abstract = {Only anecdotal data are available on the pharmacokinetics ({PK}) of miltefosine in children suffering from visceral leishmaniasis ({VL}). While failure rates were higher in children with {VL}, steady-state concentrations appeared lower than those seen with adults. We hypothesized that the current linear dosage (in milligrams per kilogram of body weight) is too low for children and that a new dosing algorithm based on an appropriate body size model would result in an optimal exposure. A population {PK} analysis was performed on three historic pooled data sets, including Indian children, Indian adults, and European adults. Linear and allometric scaling of {PK} parameters by either body weight or fat-free mass ({FFM}) was evaluated for body size models. Based on the developed {PK} model, a dosing algorithm for miltefosine in children and adults was proposed and evaluated in silico. The population {PK} model employing allometric scaling fitted best to the pooled miltefosine data. Allometric scaling by {FFM} reduced between-subject variability, e.g., for drug clearance, from 49.6\% to 32.1\%. A new allometric miltefosine dosing algorithm was proposed. Exposure to miltefosine was lower in children than adults receiving 2.5 mg/kg/day: a C(max) of 18.8 ug/ml was reached by 90\% of adults and 66.7\% of children. The allometric daily dose resulted in similar levels of exposure to miltefosine for adults and children. The use of a new allometric dosing algorithm for miltefosine in {VL} patients results in optimal exposure to miltefosine in both adults and children and might improve clinical outcome in children.},
