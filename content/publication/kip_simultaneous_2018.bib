  abstract = {Objectives: Leishmania parasites reside within macrophages and the direct target of antileishmanial drugs is therefore intracellular. We aimed to characterize the intracellular {PBMC} miltefosine kinetics by developing a population pharmacokinetic ({PK}) model simultaneously describing plasma and intracellular {PBMC} pharmacokinetics. Furthermore, we explored exposure-response relationships and simulated alternative dosing regimens.
Patients and methods: A population {PK} model was developed with {NONMEM}, based on 339 plasma and 194 {PBMC} miltefosine concentrations from Colombian cutaneous leishmaniasis patients [29 children (2-12 years old) and 22 adults] receiving 1.8-2.5 mg/kg/day miltefosine for 28 days.
Results: A three-compartment model with miltefosine distribution into an intracellular {PBMC} effect compartment best fitted the data. Intracellular {PBMC} distribution was described with an intracellular-to-plasma concentration ratio of 2.17 [relative standard error ({RSE}) 4.9\%] and intracellular distribution rate constant of 1.23 day-1 ({RSE} 14\%). In exploring exposure-response relationships, both plasma and intracellular model-based exposure estimates significantly influenced probability of cure. A proposed {PK} target for the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (day 0-28) of \>535 mg\*day/L corresponded to \>95\% probability of cure. In linear dosing simulations, 18.3\% of children compared with 2.8\% of adults failed to reach 535 mg\*day/L. In children, this decreased to 1.8\% after allometric dosing simulation.
Conclusions: The developed population {PK} model described the rate and extent of miltefosine distribution from plasma into {PBMCs}. Miltefosine exposure was significantly related to probability of cure in this cutaneous leishmaniasis patient population. We propose an exploratory {PK} target, which should be validated in a larger cohort study.},
