  abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis ({CL}) and mucosal leishmaniasis ({ML}) in travelers is still controversial. Over the last decade, national and international consortia have published recommendations for treating {CL} in travelers. These guidelines harmonize many issues, but there are some discrepancies.
{METHODS}: Leishmania parasites causing {CL} can now be genotyped by polymerase chain reaction techniques for detecting Leishmania {DNA}. Therefore, treatment recommendations can now be species based rather than based on geographical exposure. To review the evidence on which the recommendations were based, {"}{LeishMan}{"} (Leishmaniasis Management), a group of experts from 13 institutions in eight European countries, performed a {PubMed} {MEDLINE}) literature search and considered unpublished evidence and the experts' own personal experiences. The Oxford evidence grading system was used to evaluate the information.
{RESULTS} {AND} {CONCLUSION}: In this article, the authors provide practical treatment recommendations for imported {CL} and {ML} in Europe, drawn up from the review by the European experts.},
