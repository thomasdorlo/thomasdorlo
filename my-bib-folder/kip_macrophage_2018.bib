  abstract = {The Leishmania parasite resides and replicates within host macrophages during visceral leishmaniasis ({VL}). This study aimed to evaluate neopterin, a marker of macrophage activation, as possible pharmacodynamic biomarker to monitor {VL} treatment response and to predict long-term clinical relapse of {VL}. Following informed consent, 497 plasma samples were collected from East-African {VL} patients receiving a 28-day miltefosine monotherapy (48 patients) or 11-day combination therapy of miltefosine and liposomal amphotericin B (L-{AMB}, 48 patients). Neopterin was quantified with {ELISA}. Values are reported as median (inter-quartile range). Baseline neopterin concentrations were elevated in all {VL} patients at 98.8 (63.9-135) nmol/L compared to reported levels for healthy controls ({\textless}10 nmol/L). During the first treatment week, concentrations remained stable in monotherapy patients (p = 0.807), but decreased two-fold compared to baseline in the combination therapy patients (p {\textless} 0.01). In the combination therapy arm, neopterin concentrations increased significantly 1 day after L-{AMB} infusion compared to baseline for cured patients [137 (98.5-197) nmol/L, p {\textless} 0.01], but not for relapsing patients [84.4 (68.9-106) nmol/L, p = 0.96]. The neopterin parameter with the highest predictive power for {VL} relapse was a higher than 8\% neopterin concentration increase between end of treatment and day 60 follow-up ({ROC} {AUC} 0.84), with a 93\% sensitivity and 65\% specificity. In conclusion, the identified neopterin parameter could be a potentially useful surrogate endpoint to identify patients in clinical trials at risk of relapse earlier during follow-up, possibly in a panel of biomarkers to increase its specificity.},
