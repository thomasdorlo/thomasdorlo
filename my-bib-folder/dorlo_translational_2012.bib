  abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Use of miltefosine in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis ({VL}) is hampered by its potential teratogenicity. The duration of adequate contraceptive cover in females of child-bearing potential after cessation of a potentially teratogenic drug therapy remains debated. The objective of this study was to provide a rational approach to suggest durations of contraceptive cover for various miltefosine regimens.
{METHODS}: A human reproductive safety threshold exposure limit was derived using animal-to-human dose conversion. Pharmacokinetic ({PK}) data for miltefosine in females are lacking; a previously developed population {PK} model and a comprehensive anthropometric dataset were used to simulate {PK} data for Indian female {VL} patients receiving miltefosine for 5, 7, 10 or 28 days. Probability of supra-threshold miltefosine exposure was used to evaluate adequate durations of post-treatment contraceptive cover for the various regimens.
{RESULTS}: {PK} data were simulated for 465 treated Indian female {VL} patients of child-bearing potential with a median age of 25 years ({IQR} 16-31 years) and median weight of 38 kg ({IQR} 34-42 kg). From animal reproductive toxicity studies, a human reproductive safety threshold exposure limit was derived of 24.5 ug\*day/{mL}. Probability of 'unprotected' supra-threshold miltefosine exposure was very low (\<0.2%) for a post-treatment contraceptive cover period of 4 months for the standard 28 day regimen, and of 2 months for the shorter regimens.
{CONCLUSIONS}: To our knowledge, this is the first study providing rational suggestions for contraceptive cover for a teratogenic drug based on animal-to-human dose conversion. For the 28 day miltefosine regimen, post-treatment contraceptive cover may be extended to 4 months, whereas for all shorter regimens 2 months may be adequate.},
