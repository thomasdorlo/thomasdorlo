  abstract = {Phagocytes, the physiological compartment in which Leishmania parasites reside, are the main site of action of the drug miltefosine, but the intracellular pharmacokinetics of miltefosine remain unexplored. We developed a bioanalytical method to quantify miltefosine in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMCs}), expanding from an existing high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the quantification of miltefosine in plasma. The method introduced deuterated miltefosine as an internal standard. Miltefosine was extracted from {PBMC} pellets by addition of 62.5% methanol. Supernatant was collected, evaporated and reconstituted in plasma. Chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed phase C18 column and detection with a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. Miltefosine was quantified using plasma calibration standards ranging from 4 to 1000ng/{mL}. This method was validated with respect to its {PBMC} matrix effect, selectivity, recovery and stability. No matrix effect could be observed from the {PBMC} content (ranging from 0.17 to 26.3\*10(6){PBMCs}) reconstituted in plasma, as quality control samples were within 3.0% of the nominal concentration (precision less than 7.7%). At the lower limit of quantitation of 4 ng/{mL} plasma, corresponding to 0.12ng/10(6) {PBMCs} in a typical clinical sample, measured concentrations were within 8.6% of the nominal value. Recovery showed to be reproducible as adding additional pre-treatment steps did not increase the recovery with more than 9%. This method was successfully applied to measure intracellular miltefosine concentrations in {PBMC} samples from six cutaneous leishmaniasis patients up to one month post-treatment.},
