  abstract = {Within its mammalian host, Leishmania resides and replicates as an intracellular parasite. The direct activity of antileishmanials must therefore depend on intracellular drug transport, metabolism, and accumulation within the host cell. In this study, we explored the role of human macrophage transporters in the intracellular accumulation and antileishmanial activity of miltefosine ({MLF}), the only oral drug available for the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis ({CL}). Membrane transporter gene expression in primary human macrophages infected in vitro with Leishmania Viannia panamensis and exposed to {MLF} showed modulation of {ABC} and solute liquid carrier transporters gene transcripts. Among these, {ABCA}3, a lipid transporter, was significantly induced after exposure to {MLF}, and this induction was confirmed in primary macrophages from {CL} patients. Functional validation of {MLF} as a substrate for {ABCA}3 was performed by {shRNA} gene knockdown ({KD}) in {THP}-1 monocytes. Intracellular accumulation of radiolabeled {MLF} was significantly higher in {ABCA}3({KD}) macrophages. {ABCA}3({KD}) resulted in increased cytotoxicity induced by {MLF} exposure. {ABCA}3 gene expression inversely correlated with intracellular {MLF} content in primary macrophages from {CL} patients. {ABCA}3({KD}) reduced parasite survival during macrophage infection with an L. V. panamensis strain exhibiting low in vitro susceptibility to {MLF}. Confocal microscopy showed {ABCA}3 to be located in the cell membrane of resting macrophages and in intracellular compartments in L. V. panamensis-infected cells. These results provide evidence of {ABCA}3 as an {MLF} efflux transporter in human macrophages and support its role in the direct antileishmanial effect of this alkylphosphocholine drug.},
