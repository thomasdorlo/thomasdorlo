  abstract = {To facilitate future pharmacokinetic studies of combination treatments against leishmaniasis in remote regions in which the disease is endemic, a simple cheap sampling method is required for miltefosine quantification. The aims of this study were to validate a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to quantify miltefosine in dried blood spot ({DBS}) samples and to validate its use with Ethiopian patients with visceral leishmaniasis ({VL}). Since hematocrit (Ht) levels are typically severely decreased in {VL} patients, returning to normal during treatment, the method was evaluated over a range of clinically relevant Ht values. Miltefosine was extracted from {DBS} samples using a simple method of pretreatment with methanol, resulting in {\textgreater}97\% recovery. The method was validated over a calibration range of 10 to 2,000 ng/ml, and accuracy and precision were within ?11.2\% and ?7.0\% (?19.1\% at the lower limit of quantification), respectively. The method was accurate and precise for blood spot volumes between 10 and 30 ?l and for Ht levels of 20 to 35\%, although a linear effect of Ht levels on miltefosine quantification was observed in the bioanalytical validation. {DBS} samples were stable for at least 162 days at 37?C. Clinical validation of the method using paired {DBS} and plasma samples from 16 {VL} patients showed a median observed {DBS}/plasma miltefosine concentration ratio of 0.99, with good correlation (Pearson'sr= 0.946). Correcting for patient-specific Ht levels did not further improve the concordance between the sampling methods. This successfully validated method to quantify miltefosine in {DBS} samples was demonstrated to be a valid and practical alternative to venous blood sampling that can be applied in future miltefosine pharmacokinetic studies with leishmaniasis patients, without Ht correction.},
