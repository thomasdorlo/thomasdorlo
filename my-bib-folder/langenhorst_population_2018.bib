  abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Fludarabine is often used as an important drug in reduced toxicity conditioning regimens prior to hematopoietic cell transplantation ({HCT}). As no definitive pharmacokinetic ({PK}) basis for {HCT} dosing for the wide age and weight range in {HCT} is available, linear body surface area ({BSA})-based dosing is still used.
{OBJECTIVE}: We sought to describe the population {PK} of fludarabine in {HCT} recipients of all ages.
{METHODS}: From 258 {HCT} recipients aged 0.3-74 years, 2605 samples were acquired on days 1 (42%), 2 (17%), 3 (4%) and 4 (37%) of conditioning. Herein, the circulating metabolite of fludarabine was quantified, and derived concentration-time data were used to build a population {PK} model using non-linear mixed-effects modelling.
{RESULTS}: Variability was extensive where area under the curve ranged from 10 to 66 mg\*h/L. A three-compartment model with first-order kinetics best described the data. Actual body weight ({BW}) with standard allometric scaling was found to be the best body-size descriptor for all {PK} parameters. Estimated glomerular filtration rate ({eGFR}) was included as a descriptor of renal function. Thus, clearance was differentiated into a non-renal (3.24+/-20% L/h/70 kg) and renal ({eGFR} 0.782+/-11% L/h/70 kg) component. The typical volumes of distribution of the central (V1), peripheral (V2), and second peripheral (V3) compartments were 39+/-8%, 20+/-11%, and 50+/-9% L/70 kg respectively. Intercompartmental clearances between V1 and V2, and V1 and V3, were 8.6+/-8% and 3.8+/-13% L/h/70 kg, respectively.
{CONCLUSION}: {BW} and {eGFR} are important predictors of fludarabine {PK}. Therefore, current linear {BSA}-based dosing leads to highly variable exposure, which may lead to variable treatment outcome.},
