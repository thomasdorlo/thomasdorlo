  abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {SSG}\&{PM} over 17 days is recommended as first line treatment for visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Africa, but is painful and requires hospitalization. Combination regimens including {AmBisome} and miltefosine are safe and effective in India, but there are no published data from trials of combination therapies including these drugs from Africa.
{METHODS}: A phase {II} open-label, non-comparative randomized trial was conducted in Sudan and Kenya to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three treatment regimens: 10 mg/kg single dose {AmBisome} plus 10 days of {SSG} (20 mg/kg/day), 10 mg/kg single dose {AmBisome} plus 10 days of miltefosine (2.5mg/kg/day) and miltefosine alone (2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days). The primary endpoint was initial parasitological cure at Day 28, and secondary endpoints included definitive cure at Day 210, and pharmacokinetic (miltefosine) and pharmacodynamic assessments.
{RESULTS}: In sequential analyses with 49-51 patients per arm, initial cure was 85\% (95\% {CI}: 73-92) in all arms. At D210, definitive cure was 87\% (95\% {CI}: 77-97) for {AmBisome} + {SSG}, 77\% (95\% {CI} 64-90) for {AmBisome} + miltefosine and 72\% (95\% {CI} 60-85) for miltefosine alone, with lower efficacy in younger patients, who weigh less. Miltefosine pharmacokinetic data indicated under-exposure in children compared to adults.
{CONCLUSION}: No major safety concerns were identified, but point estimates of definitive cure were less than 90\% for each regimen so none will be evaluated in Phase {III} trials in their current form. Allometric dosing of miltefosine in children needs to be evaluated.
{TRIAL} {REGISTRATION}: The study was registered with {ClinicalTrials}.gov, number {NCT}01067443.},
