  abstract = {Balamuthia mandrillaris, a free-living ameba, causes rare but frequently fatal granulomatous amebic encephalitis ({GAE}). Few patients have survived after receiving experimental drug combinations, with or without brain lesion excisions. Some {GAE} survivors have been treated with a multi-drug regimen including miltefosine, an investigational anti-leishmanial agent with in vitro amebacidal activity. Miltefosine dosing for {GAE} has been based on leishmaniasis dosing because no data exist in humans concerning its pharmacologic distribution in the central nervous system. We describe results of limited cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) and serum drug level testing performed during clinical management of a child with fatal {GAE} who was treated with a multiple drug regimen including miltefosine. Brain biopsy specimens, {CSF}, and sera were tested for B. mandrillaris using multiple techniques, including culture, real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemical techniques, and serology. {CSF} and serum miltefosine levels were determined using a liquid chromatography method coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The {CSF} miltefosine concentration on hospital admission day 12 was 0.4 ug/{mL}. The serum miltefosine concentration on day 37, about 80h post-miltefosine treatment, was 15.3 ug/{mL}. These are the first results confirming some blood-brain barrier penetration by miltefosine in a human, although with low-level {CSF} accumulation. Further evaluation of brain parenchyma penetration is required to determine optimal miltefosine dosing for Balamuthia {GAE}, balanced with the drug's toxicity profile. Additionally, the Balamuthia isolate was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}), demonstrating genetic variability in 18S ribosomal {RNA} (18S {rRNA}) sequences and possibly signaling the first identification of multiple Balamuthia strains with varying pathogenicities.},
