  abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Miltefosine ({MIL}), the only oral drug for visceral leishmaniasis ({VL}), is currently the first-line therapy in the {VL} elimination program of the Indian subcontinent. Given the paucity of anti-{VL} drugs and the looming threat of resistance, there is an obvious need for close monitoring of clinical efficacy of {MIL}.
{METHODS}: In a cohort study of 120 {VL} patients treated with {MIL} in Nepal, we monitored the clinical outcomes up to 12 months after completion of therapy and explored the potential role of drug compliance, parasite drug resistance, and reinfection.
{RESULTS}: The initial cure rate was 95.8\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 92.2-99.4) and the relapse rate at 6 and 12 months was 10.8\% (95\% {CI}, 5.2-16.4) and 20.0\% (95\% {CI}, 12.8-27.2) , respectively. No significant clinical risk factors of relapse apart from age {\textless}12 years were found. Parasite fingerprints of pretreatment and relapse bone marrow isolates within 8 patients were similar, suggesting that clinical relapses were not due to reinfection with a new strain. The mean promastigote {MIL} susceptibility (50\% inhibitory concentration) of isolates from definite cures was similar to that of relapses. Although more tolerant strains were observed, parasite resistance, as currently measured, is thus not likely involved in {MIL} treatment failure. Moreover, {MIL} blood levels at the end of treatment were similar in cured and relapsed patients.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Relapse in one-fifth of the {MIL}-treated patients observed in our study is an alarming signal for the {VL} elimination campaign, urging for further review and cohort monitoring.},
