  abstract = {Patients with visceral leishmaniasis ({VL})-human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) coinfection experience increased drug toxicity and treatment failure rates compared to {VL} patients, with more frequent {VL} relapse and death. In the era of {VL} elimination strategies, {HIV} coinfection is progressively becoming a key challenge, because {HIV}-coinfected patients respond poorly to conventional {VL} treatment and play an important role in parasite transmission. With limited chemotherapeutic options and a paucity of novel anti-parasitic drugs, new interventions that target host immunity may offer an effective alternative. In this review, we first summarize current views on how {VL} immunopathology is significantly affected by {HIV} coinfection. We then review current clinical and promising preclinical immunomodulatory interventions in the field of {VL} and discuss how these may operate in the context of a concurrent {HIV} infection. Caveats are formulated as these interventions may unpredictably impact the delicate balance between boosting of beneficial {VL}-specific responses and deleterious immune activation/hyperinflammation, activation of latent provirus or increased {HIV}-susceptibility of target cells. Evidence is lacking to prioritize a target molecule and a more detailed account of the immunological status induced by the coinfection as well as surrogate markers of cure and protection are still required. We do, however, argue that virologically suppressed {VL} patients with a recovered immune system, in whom effective antiretroviral therapy alone is not able to restore protective immunity, can be considered a relevant target group for an immunomodulatory intervention. Finally, we provide perspectives on the translation of novel theories on synergistic immune cell cross-talk into an effective treatment strategy for {VL}-{HIV}-coinfected patients.},
