  abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {OBJECTIVES}: Caspofungin is an echinocandin antifungal agent used as first-line therapy for the treatment of invasive candidiasis. The maintenance dose is adapted to body weight ({BW}) or liver function (Child-Pugh score B or C). We aimed to study the pharmacokinetics of caspofungin and assess pharmacokinetic target attainment for various dosing strategies.
{METHODS}: Caspofungin pharmacokinetic data from 21 intensive care unit ({ICU}) patients was available. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed. Various dosing regimens (loading dose/maintenance dose) were simulated: licensed regimens (I) 70/50 mg (for {BW} \<80 kg) or 70/70 mg (for {BW} \<80 kg); and ({II}) 70/35 mg (for Child-Pugh score B); and adapted regimens ({III}) 100/50 mg (for Child-Pugh score B); ({IV}) 100/70 mg; and (V) 100/100 mg. Target attainment based on a preclinical pharmacokinetic target for Candida albicans was assessed for relevant minimal inhibitory concentrations ({MICs}).
{RESULTS}: A two-compartment model best fitted the data. Clearance was 0.55 L/h and the apparent volumes of distribution in the central and peripheral compartments were 8.9 and 5.0 L, respectively. The median area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 24h on day 14 for regimens I-V were 105, 65, 93, 130, and 186 mg\*h/L, respectively. Pharmacokinetic target attainment was 100% ({MIC} 0.03ug/{mL}) irrespective of dosing regimen but decreased to (I) 47%, ({II}) 14%, ({III}) 36%, ({IV}) 69%, and (V) 94% for {MIC} 0.125ug/{mL}.
{CONCLUSION}: The caspofungin maintenance dose should not be reduced in non-cirrhotic {ICU} patients based on the Child-Pugh score if this classification is driven by hypoalbuminemia as it results in significantly lower exposure. A higher maintenance dose of 70 mg in {ICU} patients results in target attainment of \>90% of the {ICU} patients with species with an {MIC} of up to 0.125 ug/{mL}.},
