abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Caspofungin is an echinocandin antifungal agent used as first-line therapy for the treatment of invasive candidiasis. The maintenance dose is adapted to body weight (BW) or liver function (Child-Pugh score B or C). We aimed to study the pharmacokinetics of caspofungin and assess pharmacokinetic target attainment for various dosing strategies. METHODS: Caspofungin pharmacokinetic data from 21 intensive care unit (ICU) patients was available. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed. Various dosing regimens (loading dose/maintenance dose) were simulated: licensed regimens (I) 70/50Â mg (for BW \\textless80Â kg) or 70/70Â mg (for BW \\textgreater80Â kg); and (II) 70/35Â mg (for Child-Pugh score B); and adapted regimens (III) 100/50Â mg (for Child-Pugh score B); (IV) 100/70Â mg; and (V) 100/100Â mg. Target attainment based on a preclinical pharmacokinetic target for Candida albicans was assessed for relevant minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). RESULTS: A two-compartment model best fitted the data. Clearance was 0.55Â L/h and the apparent volumes of distribution in the central and peripheral compartments were 8.9 and 5.0Â L, respectively. The median area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 24Â h on dayÂ 14 for regimens I-V were 105, 65, 93, 130, and 186Â mgÂ·h/L, respectively. Pharmacokinetic target attainment was 100Â \\% (MIC 0.03Â Âµg/mL) irrespective of dosing regimen but decreased to (I) 47Â \\%, (II) 14Â \\%, (III) 36Â \\%, (IV) 69Â \\%, and (V) 94Â \\% for MIC 0.125Â Âµg/mL. CONCLUSION: The caspofungin maintenance dose should not be reduced in non-cirrhotic ICU patients based on the Child-Pugh score if this classification is driven by hypoalbuminemia as it results in significantly lower exposure. A higher maintenance dose of 70Â mg in ICU patients results in target attainment ofÂ \\textgreater90Â \\% of the ICU patients with species with an MIC of up to 0.125Â Âµg/mL."
